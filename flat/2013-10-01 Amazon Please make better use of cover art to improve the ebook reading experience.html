  As we pass through the transition from paper to electronic books, the humble
  book cover seems to have been dropped from important roles in the reading
  experience. I'm generally a huge fan of Amazon's various Kindle devices and
  apps, and love the convenience that goes with them. But I'm finding some
  aspects of the current Kindle reading experience leave me cold, and make
  recalling a book harder than it should be.
</p>
<p>
  We usually don't think much about the covers of the books we're reading, but
  each time you reach for a paper copy of a book, you have a chance to see a
  cover:
</p>
<p>

  />
</p>
<p>
  This cover is hard at work. Before you've even cracked the book, the art and
  typography have played a subtle but useful role in setting the <em>mood</em>
  for the reading experience. Yes, the cover is serving as advertising, but it’s
  also an earnest attempt to visually establish the tone of what follows.
  Details such font choice, text size, color palette, image content, and
  composition, all contribute to provoking an emotional shift before you've even
  reached the primary content. In this light, a cover is something like a
  movie’s opening credits. In both cases, subtracting the aesthetic treatment
  leaves behind bare content that has to work harder to make an emotional
  impact.
</p>
<p>
  More lastingly, the cover helps to repeatedly connect the book's title,
  author, and content in your brain. During the course of reading a book, you
  likely see its cover numerous times (even if the cover's only facing up half
  the time). I'd hazard that the cover for a typical paper novel creates
  something on the order of 20–40 visual impressions for the average reader
  between the time they see it in a store and the time they put that book out of
  sight.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, let's quickly consider the use of book cover art in Amazon
  ebooks. When you buy a book on Amazon's Kindle store, you can see a small
  thumbnail of the cover art:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Amazon Search Results.png"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e2019affb30a3f970b-pi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  You can also see a book's thumbnail in a device or app's the Library view. But
  when you tap on a book to open it, you're brought straight to the first page
  of text:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Kindle Book First Page.PNG"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e2019affb3ad84970d-pi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Jumping to the first page of text <em>seems</em> really efficient — but by
  skipping the cover, some things are lost. The title is presented here, but in
  such a subdued way that it’s easy to overlook. The author's name isn't even
  shown in portrait view. (You have to rotate the presentation to landscape,
  two-column view for that.) And, once you've begun a book, when you return to
  the Kindle app or device again, you'll jump straight back to the page you were
  on —&nbsp;skipping even the small cover art thumbnail in the Library view.
</p>
<p>
  The digital cover art <em>is</em> typically still there in the ebook content;
  it's just not shown to you by default. And if you explicitly do view the
  cover, you will see an odd thing: the cover art presented as an image sitting
  <em>on </em>one of the book's pages, instead of a cover that's the same size
  as a page. This makes the cover feel less like a cover, and even less
  important than the user interface is already treating it.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Overall, I think Amazon's doing an amazing job with ebooks. I do think the
  cover art could be handled more effectively. As it stands, you can lose out on
  quite a bit as a reader of an ebook:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you can't remember a title or author, you can't easily recommend the book
    to friends. I’ve frequently found myself trying to tell friends about an
    interesting ebook I’m reading —&nbsp;a book I may have been reading for a
    couple of weeks —&nbsp;only to discover I can recall neither the title nor
    the author’s name.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you can't recall an author's name, you yourself might not be able to
    later find more books by the same author. Yes, you could dig up the name
    through your order history, but maybe you're not going to bother. It'd be a
    lot faster if you could just recall the name and type it into a search box.
  </li>
  <li>
    The art probably helps aid the recall of the book's content. Conversely,
    failure to show that cover likely means that information is probably harder
    to recall. I can still remember some covers for books I read decades ago. I
    doubt that persistence will remain true about the ebooks I'm reading today.
  </li>
  <li>
    Everything on the book’s cover, including the artwork and typography, is
    helping to prepare the stage for the reading experience you’re about to
    start (or resume). Leaving that out can make the e-book reading experience
    feel comparatively colder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Without a strong visual distinction between different books, the experience
    of reading ebook after ebook can make those books blur together in your
    mind.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Curiously, Kindle devices do show book covers, but
  <em>for the wrong book</em>. When you turn off the device, you'll get an ad
  for some book you don't yet own. I appreciate Amazon's business need to sell
  more books, but this feels rather pathetic. I've never personally found any of
  these recommendations useful, and in any event I already have many ways — and
  better ways — to find recommendations when I visit the Amazon site. Moreover,
  this advertising makes the reading experience so haphazard. Because I get a
  different book cover each time I turn off a Kindle device, the lack of
  persistence makes it even harder to appreciate a multi-day reading process as
  a coherent experience.
</p>
<p>
  What might work better? I'm sure the Kindle designers have already given this
  a lot of thought. I'm not an expert in ebook user interfaces, just a reader
  who's been feeling underserved by the current experience, but I think it might
  be reasonable for the Kindle apps and devices to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Flash the book’s cover for second when opening a book for the first time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Flash the book's cover for some shorter time (half a second?) when
    re-opening a book.
  </li>
  <li>
    Skip this cover display if the user goes away and then returns to a book
    within some short interval, say, less than an hour. If they've just flipped
    away to check something and come right back, even a short delay might feel
    obtrusive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let the user turn off this cover behavior through an option if they're
    really obsessed with getting that second back.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the Kindle devices, the cover of the current book should be shown when
    the device is off. Again, if the user really wants to hide which book
    they’re reading, perhaps the existing behavior could be retained as an
    option.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  What has your experience been? If you know anyone at Amazon who’s in a
  position to reconsider the current handling of cover art, I'd love it if you
  could please point them at these suggestions.
