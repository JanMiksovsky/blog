<p>
  Image-sharing site <a href="http://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> is the current
  darling of the social media world, and the core of its user experience is its
  attractively-designed home page:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Pinterest"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e20163027f804d970d-pi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  This page takes good advantage of available window real estate. As the user
  makes the window wider, the page re-lays out the columns of image tiles (or
  “pins”, in the parlance of the site) to take advantage of the extra width:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Pinterest (Wider)"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201676373f8a6970b-pi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  The page must accommodate a wide range of tile heights, as the photos have
  different aspect ratios, and the number of comments per pin can vary. If the
  page simply laid out the tiles in a strict grid, it would waste a great deal
  of space. To use the space more efficiently, the page employs a “packed
  columns” layout.
</p>
<p><strong>Key attributes</strong></p>
<p>The packed columns layout algorithm is straightforward:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Divide available width by the standard item width to determine how many
    columns can fit.
  </li>
  <li>Make all columns initially empty.</li>
  <li>
    For each item in turn, add the item to the column which is currently
    shortest.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The simplicity of this algorithm is such that it’s been independently
  recreated multiple times. The algorithm has some nice properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s fast.</li>
  <li>
    As much horizontal space is used as possible (while still showing entire
    items). If a user gives the site more width, they’re rewarded with more
    information.
  </li>
  <li>The arrangement is visually interesting.</li>
  <li>The positions of the first few items are stable.</li>
  <li>
    At any given page width, the overall heights of the columns will be roughly
    equivalent. If the user scrolls to the bottom, they won’t find an unbalanced
    amount of space under any particular column.
  </li>
  <li>
    The relative vertical position of any two items is preserved across resize
    operations. If item A appears above item B at one window size, then item A
    will always be above (or on the same row) as item B at any other window
    size. The user doesn’t need to understand this; it just means that if some
    interesting item is “near the top” before a resize, then after the resize
    the same interesting item will still be “near the top”.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The last point speaks to another benefit of the algorithm which doesn’t show
  up in Pinterest, but does show up in other applications: the consistent
  relative positions of items means you can offer users the ability to specify
  an order or prioritization for the items that affects (but doesn’t completely
  determine) where items end up. I used this years ago in the design for a home
  page for Microsoft Money, a personal finance application whose home page
  included a user-customizable set of home page modules. A Settings dialog let
  the user specify the priority of those modules by dragging the modules within
  a one-dimensional list. While the ultimate two-dimensional position of the
  modules depended on the window width and the modules’ current heights, the
  priority of any given module determined how close to the top of the page that
  module would end up. This limited degree of customization was sufficient to
  meet many users’ needs without having to create a full-blown customizable
  layout UI.
</p>
<p><strong>PackedColumns</strong></p>
<p>
  I’ve added a
  <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/PackedColumns">PackedColumns</a> control
  to the QuickUI Catalog. There’s a link to a
  <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/PackedColumns/demo.html">demo</a> that
  simulates the general appearance of Pinterest’s home page. (I initially
  centered the items in the demo the way Pinterest does, but turned centering
  off to make it easier to observe the layout behavior.)
</p>
<p>
  Usage: Use PackedColumns to arrange a collection of child elements whose
  widths are fixed but whose heights vary substantially. If the heights are
  relatively consistent, users will likely find a traditional grid presentation
  easier to interpret and use.
</p>
<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>
  Given the simplicity of the algorithm, this wasn’t all that hard to code
  up.&#0160;I expect it’s not necessarily the actual cost of a layout like this
  that deters sites from adopting it. Rather, it’s the current need to
  independently discover or reverse-engineer behavior like this that most
  inhibits its adoption. As design knowledge gets coded into controls, however,
  such UI should become more pervasive.
</p>
<p>
  In essence, an ability to easily create and adopt create web components will
  lead to a commodification of user interface elements. Today Pinterest’s
  insight and ability to create a packed columns layout may confer a slight
  competitive edge, but someday commodification will quickly eliminate such
  edges. This will be true not just for UI elements that can easily be
  independently created, but for nearly anything. The day after a new site
  launches with a cool new UI trick, that trick will be copied and packaged up
  as an openly available and readily adoptable UI control anyone can use.
