The Origami language gives #smallweb/#indieweb creators functions for making parts of web sites in the same way a spreadsheet offers functions for crunching numbers: give a function some input, get something useful back.

Case in point: every so often I want a web page to show a screenshot of another web page. Puppeteer is great for that but cumbersome to set up, so I made screenshot functions: give them HTML or a URL, get back an image. https://github.com/WebOrigami/extensions/tree/main/screenshot

I used this to make a new Examples page on the Origami docs site. A build script uses the screenshot function to take pictures of each sample URL, producing a virtual folder of images that get saved as real images for deployment. This will make it easy to add new samples or update the screenshots as the sample sites evolve. https://weborigami.org/language/examples
