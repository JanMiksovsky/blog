I continue to be amazed at what's possible in a static (or nearly static) website. For this month's #SmallWebBuild, I made a static site that's a little store for selling art prints. This seems like a viable alternative to hosting your store on a big platform that you don't control. #smallweb

The Cat Prints Store at https://cat-prints-store.weborigami.org is defined in a single file in the Origami site design language that turns the sample artwork images and data into a gallery home page and a separate page for each print.

I built this to try out Snipcart (https://snipcart.com), a service for adding a shopping cart to a static site. They seem to charge lower fees than the larger site hosting platforms, and it was trivial to add the shopping cart with a few HTML attributes. I **love** that their approach leaves you in control of the rest of your site. (That said, I'm not using Snipcart to actually execute financial transactions; if you're interested in Snipcart, investigate it carefully.)

I also used this store site to experiment with the new View Transitions API. I was able to create a zoom effect in #CSS that works _across page navigations (!)_ which is completely nuts. Caveats: currently in Chrome/Edge/Opera only; it was hard to figure out how to do what I wanted; Chrome often shows a white flash before the zoom-out animation. Still, I'm excited to see these effects coming to simple multi-page sites.
