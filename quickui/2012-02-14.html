<p>
  The documentation for the QuickUI Catalog, which now contains 60+ controls,
  has been updated to include documentation of each class' properties and
  methods.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, the only way to see how to use a control was to read the original
  control source code on GitHub. Now the descriptions for a class' members are
  extracted from the source, and then used to populate the documentation page
  for that class. For example, the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-catalog/blob/master/quickui.catalog/ListBox.qui"
    >ListBox source</a
  >
  is parsed to create the
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ListBox/">ListBox</a> documentation page.
</p>
