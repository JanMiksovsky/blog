<p>
  The new <a href="http://quickui.org/tutorial/">QuickUI Tutorial</a> shows you
  how to use QuickUI in plain JavaScript, without the need for a proprietary
  markup language or client-side compiler.
</p>
<p>
  The tutorial is divided into two sections: the first shows how you can use
  QuickUI controls in your site (e.g., one mostly constructed via some other
  tool), and the second shows how to create your own QuickUI controls. The
  tutorial is built around small interactive coding exercises, each of which
  demonstrates some aspect of the framework. Due to current limitations of the
  code editor, the tutorial is not functional in IE8 and Safari. It works fine
  in Chrome, Firefox, and IE9.
</p>
<p>
  The existingÂ markup tutorial has been moved to a new
  <a href="http://quickui.org/markup/">Markup</a> section that also now hosts
  the Downloads page for the client-side compiler. This reorganization helps
  emphasize the fact that the use of QuickUI markup is an optional, somewhat
  advanced mode of use; markup is no longer required to use or create QuickUI
  controls.
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial represents the first of several forthcoming steps to make
  QuickUI more appealing to a wider JavaScript audience.
