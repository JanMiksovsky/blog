<p>
  A carousel is a great candidate for a web component: it’s a popular user
  interface pattern useful in a wide variety of contexts, but which contains
  many tricky details that would benefit from a shared implementation.
  Unfortunately, no single carousel component can work well in all situations,
  and such a thing would require so many customization options as to be
  unworkable. No one should waste time trying to forge the One Carousel
  Component To Rule Them All.

  The
  <a href="http://basicwebcomponents.org">Basic Web Components</a>
  project spends a <em>lot</em> of time thinking about how to build carousels,
  because they’re a useful proving ground for ideas about factoring web
  components. A good implementation strategy for carousels should work for other
  complex user interface patterns with many variations. This post digs into the
  complexity behind carousels. We’ll follow this post with a discussion of our
  current approach to implementing carousels as web components.
</p>

<h2>A user interface pattern with countless variations</h2>
<p>A carousel user interface typically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presents a small handful of elements (say, 3–10), usually images ...</li>
  <li>At a fairly large proportion of the visible page…</li>
  <li>Through which the user can navigate backwards and forwards…</li>
  <li>Using touch and a mouse, and sometimes with a keyboard or trackpad …</li>
  <li>
    Typically with a transitional effect that suggests lateral (side to side)
    movement.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Although the carousel pattern sounds straightforward, it comes in a stunning
  variety of variations:

<p>
  These variations aren't just stylistic in nature; they differ in the precise
  mix of features as well. Rather than thinking about a carousel as a single
  thing that could be delivered as a single component, it may be more useful to
  think of a carousel as a space of user interface possibilities. The edges of
  this space are not necessarily distinct. It blurs into the realm of
  interactive slideshows, tabbed panels, and other common patterns.
</p>

<h2>Carousel accessories</h2>
<p>
  Carousels are often adorned with accessory sub-elements, each with its own
  variations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Arrow buttons to navigate forward and back. The left and right buttons are
    generally positioned on the left and right edges of the carousel, but
    sometimes they are positioned together above or below the carousel.
    Sometimes the arrows are only shown on desktop devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dots. To let the user see how many elements are in the set, and see their
    current position in the set, small dots may be shown, usually below the
    carousel. The dots are usually round, but sometimes take other shapes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thumbnails. Similar to dots in that they show position and count, thumbnails
    are large enough to show a small representation of the corresponding image
    or element in the set. Clicking a thumbnail selects the corresponding item
    at full scale, and vice versa. These thumbnails may have their own
    transitional effects, and effectively constitute a carousel of their own
    synced to the main carousel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Page numbers. In lieu of dots, a carousel may show the position of the
    active element in the context of the larger set, e.g., showing “1 of 9” for
    the first of nine elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tabs. Occasionally a carousel is combined with tabs, or what behave like
    tabs. A typical example might be a mobile app with five main pages
    represented in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen. While the toolbar
    buttons don’t look like tabs, they effectively behave like tabs. At the same
    time, the user may be able to swipe horizontally between the app’s pages.
    That is, the pages constitute a carousel, even if they don't initially
    present themselves as a carousel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Horizontal scroll bar. This isn’t too common when a carousel shows a single
    item at a time, but is somewhat more common for short but wide carousels
    showing multiple items at once.
  </li>
  <li>
    Timer. Some carousels navigate like slideshows on a timed basis without user
    interaction. A common pattern is a large full-bleed carousel at the top of a
    site’s home page that cycles through product images, or top stories, or
    current offers. If the site allows the user to directly navigate the
    carousel, the timer typically pauses following user interaction, and then
    restarts when the user stops interacting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Play/Pause button. Carousels with a timer (above) may offer the user an
    explicit button to pause or restart the slideshow timer.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Almost every variation above may be used in combination, producing a
  combinatorial explosion of functional possibilities. This is to say nothing of
  the infinite variety of aesthetic variations possible through visual styling.
</p>

<h2>Input and output modalities</h2>
<p>Carousels need to accommodate a variety of input methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Touch swiping. You’d think this would be obvious, but today you can easily
    find web sites designed for desktop that don’t permit swiping on mobile.
    (Case in point: the web-based AirBnB carousel shown at the top of this
    post.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Mouse. This is typically handled via the accessory elements described above:
    arrow buttons, dots, thumbnails. Less commonly, clicking on the left half or
    right half of the currently-selected item in the carousel may navigate back
    or forward, respectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keyboard. If it’s annoying to find desktop carousels that don’t support
    touch, it’s equally annoying to find mobile-focused carousels that don’t
    support the keyboard. This is a critical accessibility issue, and not just
    for users that can’t use a mouse. A keyboard is often the most efficient way
    to page back and forth through a large set of items.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trackpad. Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows support native applications whose
    carousels can be navigated by swiping left or right on the trackpad. This
    input modality is just as welcome on web sites, although HTML limitations
    currently make it impossible to deliver trackpad support as good as what’s
    possible in native applications.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For output modalities, in addition to visual displays, carousels should also
  support accessibility devices such as screen readers via ARIA. Unfortunately,
  it’s currently the case that nearly all web carousels ignore accessibility,
  making it challenging or impossible for a sight-impaired user to easily
  navigate a carousel.
</p>

<h2>More variations</h2>
<p>
  During the transition from one element to another, a carousel generally shows
  some sort of horizontal animation, but again many variations are possible:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A simple sliding effect, possibly with easing.</li>
  <li>
    A sliding effect, but with a gap between adjacent elements, the better to
    delineate the boundaries between them.
  </li>
  <li>
    A reveal or cover effect, as if the items are being removed from, or added
    to, a deck of cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    A fading effect as an item comes into view and/or goes out of view, often
    combined with another effect (sliding, cover, reveal).
  </li>
  <li>
    The carousel may show a bit of the immediately adjacent items, or a number
    of adjacent items in either direction (as in Apple’s “Cover Flow” effect).
    This implies interactivity as well: tapping/clicking the adjacent items
    often navigates to the indicated item.
  </li>
  <li>
    A 3D effect showing the elements rotating in space around a central point,
    as if positioned on a real-world carousel (hence the name).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These effects can be thought of as stylistic variations, although in many
  cases they go beyond what CSS styling alone can achieve.
</p>
<p>Another point of variation is whether the carousel wraps around:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Many carousels let the user navigate forward from the last item back around
    to the first, or vice versa. This is where the analogy to a real-world
    carousel comes into play.
  </li>
  <li>
    But many carousel components don’t wrap: when the user is on the last item
    in the set, forward navigation is disabled. Similarly, backward navigation
    is disabled on the first item. This firmly establishes the size of the set
    in the user’s mind. Consider an app that uses a carousel for navigation
    through a sequence of similarly-looking Settings pages. If the carousel
    wraps around, and the user’s not paying close attention as they navigate
    forward, they might easily get the sense that the app has an infinite number
    of settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    A small number of carousels wrap in the forward direction, but not in the
    backward direction. This often comes up on sites that start the user out on
    the first item of a carefully-planned sequence — a tutorial, say. When the
    user’s completed the tutorial, the site doesn’t mind if the user goes
    forward through the tutorial again. But they want to discourage the user
    from initially jumping backward from the first item to the last because the
    user could miss critical information.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are some basic variations. The internet is a big place, and surely there
  are other variations on the carousel theme.
</p>

<h2>Combinatorial complexity</h2>
<p>
  Trying to create a single web component to encompass the breadth of variation
  suggested above would be crazy. The programmatic API surface would be huge,
  for one thing. It would be impossible to reliably test and maintain the
  expected functionality in all combinations. The API would also contain
  numerous cases of properties or methods that couldn’t (or at least shouldn’t)
  be used in combination. And such a monolithic carousel implementation would be
  very difficult to extend to handle unforeseen variations.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, there are clearly user interface aspects of carousels that
  are consistent enough that they could be delivered in a reusable form. For
  example, if someone wants arrows on the left and right of their carousel, they
  might want slightly different visuals, but the overall behavior of the arrow
  buttons would be fairly predictable and consistent. So it should be possible
  to deliver aspects of a carousel as reusable code.
</p>
<p>
  Given the complexity outlined above, what we want is a carousel construction
  kit: pieces that can be assembled into a carousel suitable for an app’s unique
  functional needs and aesthetic style. Web components can form part of that
  kit, but we’ll also need lower-level mixins and helper functions, and some new
  ways to tie components together. We’ll explore this strategy in a follow-up
  post.
