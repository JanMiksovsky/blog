<p>
  For the last few weeks I’ve been playing with an Android phone, a Motorola
  Droid X. The UI takes some adjustment for an iPhone user like me, not unlike
  they adjustment I’ve made going back and forth between the Mac and PC several
  times over the years. In evaluating the Android user experience (including
  aspects shaped by Motorola), the following points seemed interesting to me.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong
      >On a touch device, it’s easy to constantly forget the presence of the
      hardware buttons.</strong
    >
    A glowing, colorful screen with detailed interactive elements is just too
    visually compelling to remember that, in some applications, critical
    features are only available via the hardware Menu button. A typical
    experience for me has been to stare at a screen looking for the UI element
    I’m certain should be there, and only a frustrating minute realize, “Oh,
    that’s right, I forgot to check what’s hidden behind the Menu button.” If
    it’s not on the screen, I can’t be bothered to keep checking it. It took me
    forever how to get out of “directions” mode in Google Maps because I was in
    a maze of twisty little passages (all alike) each of which produced a
    slightly different Options menu when the Menu button was pressed. <br />
    <br />I think the Menu button flies in the face of evidence that users do
    better when they have a clear and consistent search path for finding the
    commands available at any given point. Jensen Harris wrote on this topic in
    his discussion of
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jensenh/archive/2005/09/14/467126.aspx"
      >why the Microsoft Office team invented the Ribbon</a
    >
    to provide “the one and only place to look for functionality in the
    product”. <br />
    <br />The same thing goes for the other hardware buttons, especially the
    Search button. It seems like a shameless ploy to plug Google search out of
    all proportion to the button’s utility. Even if an application has a Search
    feature, it seems like they’d want to be certain users remembered it was
    there by offering an on-screen UI to invoke it. Given that, why burden the
    user with an extra hardware button?<br /><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Long press to invoke commands = Win.</strong> The ability to hold
    down one’s finger on an object to invoke what’s essentially a context menu
    (“Quick Actions”) is a gain for power users, and doesn’t impact users who
    are unaware of this facility. When I go back to the iPhone, this is the
    Android feature I miss the most. Thankfully, this useful UI convention is
    already starting to make its way over to iPhone apps. <br />
    <br />On the downside, this UI will likely lead to a wave of “long press
    people”. Their habit will parallel that of “right-click people” on Windows:
    users who, at some point in the past, found the right click button produced
    some interesting commands. They therefore now right-click on everything—the
    Windows Start menu, OK buttons, <em>everything</em>—whether it has a context
    menu or not.<br /><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Dear Google: Thanks for taking the iconic dropdown arrow, an element
      which otherwise universally communicates “Click me”, and using it as a
      completely static element that offers no interaction whatsoever.</strong
    >
    <br />
    <br /><img src="/images/flowstate/radio_buttons.png" />
    <br />
    <br />That little arrow-in-a-circle next to &quot;Map mode&quot;?
    <em>Users want to click on it</em>. They want to click on it because every
    other app they have ever used has used a similar icon as an affordance for
    interactivity. By abusing this dropdown arrow icon, Google might untrain
    users from clicking on it when they see it. Google’s non-standard use of
    this arrow is precluding the standard use of it on Android. (Cozi’s own
    mobile UI plans called for using a dropdown arrow-in-a-circle very much like
    the one above, and we’ve had to abandon that for fear that Android users
    wouldn’t click on it.)<br /><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Motorola made a curious decision to set the geeky robotic “Droid” sound
      from a Droid X marketing campaign as the phone’s default error
      sound.</strong
    >
    So Motorola has decided that, at completely random intervals throughout a
    customer’s day, the device should proclaim in a loud robotic voice, “MY.
    OWNER. IS. A. GEEK.”<br /><br />If you like that, great; I&#39;m all for
    self-expression. If you want to customize your phone to announce new emails
    with Worf&#39;s voice stating, &quot;Captain... Incoming message&quot;, more
    power to you. That&#39;s your choice. Having a phone manufacturer make a
    choice like this without user participation&#0160;seems unaccountably
    presumptuous.<br /><br />This one tiny experience made me feel like Motorola
    views me as nothing more than a marketing tool, and they don&#39;t care if
    they make me feel stupid in front of my friends. I disabled the sound at the
    first opportunity. It took a bit of hunting around. Let’s imagine there’s a
    normal person out their who <em>doesn’t</em> want to have their phone scream
    that they’re a geek. How quickly will they learn to hate their new phone?<br /><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Motorola has managed to completely conflate Droid and Android in the
      minds of mainstream consumers.</strong
    >
    Perhaps this is due to the aforementioned marketing campaign, but it’s more
    likely a result of Motorola’s savvy willingness to pay Lucasfilm through the
    nose for the rights to the “Droid” name. I’ve personally seen the
    effectiveness of this branding decision—on a daily basis I see requests from
    Cozi users asking when we’re going to have a “Droid version”. It’s certain
    that many of those users are actually asking for an Android version (which
    we’re working on, BTW)<br /><br />[<strong>UPDATE:</strong> A reader pointed
    out that Verizion, not Motorola, is the firm that licensed the
    &quot;Droid&quot; trademark from Lucasfilm.]

    <strong>I still don’t see the high value of Home page widgets. </strong
    >Maybe my usage will change over time, but it still seems odd to have to,
    say, swipe my Home page to the left twice in order to see a few calendar
    appointments, when I could also just launch the Calendar app and see
    <em>all</em> my calendar appointments. When I go back to the iPhone, I don’t
    miss Home page widgets at all. Widgets seem like a great idea in theory. In
    practice I’d imagine most people just can’t be bothered to invest a bunch of
    time optimizing their phone’s Home page in order to get a miniscule gain in
    efficiency. YMMV.<br /><br />

      >It’s fantastic to be able to install apps without valueless interference
      by the carrier, manufacturer, or OS provider. </strong
    >Freedom to install the apps you want is a core part of the Android value
    proposition. It’s good for users. It’s <em>great </em>for ISVs during app
    development. Platforms that make ISVs happy often do well; the conventional
    wisdom is that it’s an unnatural—and probably unsustainable—state of nature
    for developers to hate the OS they’re developing for. Installing a
    prerelease build of Cozi’s iPhone application is a pain: I have to get my
    device ID to a developer, who has to embed that ID in a list of devices
    approved to run the prerelease build, and then have to go through
    shenanigans with iTunes to install the app. Installing a prerelease build of
    Cozi’s Android application is a breeze: just click a link to download and
    install the app, and I’m done.
