  For while now I've been trying
  <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> and
  <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a>, two members of a new
  school of sites that invert the traditional service signup experience. As
  discussed in the last post, old school sites put up numerous marketing,
  signup, and technology-related
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2007/05/hurdles_in_the_.html"
    >hurdles at the entrance to their service</a
  >. New school sites like Netvibes and Pageflakes turn this experience on its
  head: <strong>first the visitor tries the product</strong> using something
  tantamount to an anonymous account. Once the visitor is convinced they like
  the service and want to get more out of the service—only then do they complete
  the steps to form a relationship with the service.
</p>
<p>
  Both Netvibes and Pageflakes let users build and edit a highly customizable
  home page. Such home pages have existed for years, but in the past
  customizations were generally available only to users with established
  accounts. These two sites, in contrast, take a new visitor straight to their
  very own customizable home page. In Netvibes, for example, a small portion of
  the page explains what the service does, but most of the page is given over to
  functional widgets that demonstrate the service with real examples:

  /></a>

  <br />
</p>
<p>
  The general idea is that
  <strong
    >the user will figure out what the product is by using the product
    itself</strong
  >—not by reading marketing verbiage or sitting through a demo. The page
  reveals customization capabilities through a combination of self-explanatory
  elements (&quot;Type your page title here&quot;) and additional options
  revealed on hover.
</p>
<p>
  PageFlakes is very similar to Netvibes. Pageflakes does almost as good a job
  as Netvibes in welcoming visitors to their product, although for some reason
  they feel compelled to display a welcome page first. In using both sites,
  PageFlakes seems to be slightly more polished than Netvibes (though I
  personally wouldn't have attempted to build a brand around the word
  &quot;flake&quot;).

  These sites both use cookies to establish a tentative, anonymous relationship
  between you and the site. You can even enter personal data to customize the
  various widgets, but until you've established an account, you're generally
  using the service anonymously. (Of course, even without a user ID, each
  additional piece of data you enter to customize the site can be used to more
  precisely identify you.)
</p>
<p>
  You can use your anonymous account for as long as you want to, provided you
  use the same browser on the same machine to do so. Whenever you reach that
  point—maybe even months after starting to use the service—you can sign up for
  an account. The basis of your relationship with the site transfers from your
  anonymous browser cookie to a real account secured with a user ID and a
  password. (Both these sites use your email address as a user ID, to eliminate
  the signup hurdle of picking a user ID.)
</p>
<p>
  The deep principle at work is that a site doesn't need to rush to secure a
  relationship with a visitor. Inevitable interest in getting more out of the
  site (in these cases, the desire to use your customized home page from another
  location) slowly pushes you, the casual anonymous visitor, to finally forge a
  permanent relationship with the site as an identified user.
  <strong
    >The site knows a relationship with you will develop in its own
    time.</strong

</p>
<p>
  I've been searching for a compelling real-world analogy to this kind of
  anonymous trial-before-signup experience. The best I've come up with so far: a
  public library. Anyone can walk in off the street and participate in a highly
  useful basic level of service—just pick a book off the shelves and start
  reading. You can do this for as long as they want, and you don't need to
  supply identification to do so. However, when you eventually want to take a
  book home, you must &quot;upgrade&quot; to a higher level of service. You must
  establish an account with the library, and this step requires that you
  identify yourself (with, for example, a document showing your address).
</p>
<p>
  I still have yet to establish a full account with either Netvibes or
  Pageflakes, but have continued to try both out anonymously. I might never
  elect to sign up with either service. Yet, even if I eventually abandon them,
  I will have used each far longer than I ever would have if it had made me sign
  up first.
