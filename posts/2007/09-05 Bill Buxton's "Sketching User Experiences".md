    >Sketching User Experiences</a
  >
  by <a href="http://www.billbuxton.com/">Bill Buxton</a>. The author's
  attention to the presentation of examples make for an engaging book, and he
  covers some interesting ground. I came across an interesting list he presents
  (pp. 111-2) of attributes that characterize design sketches, in which he
  asserts that sketches are (or have):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Quick:</strong> A sketch is quick to make, or at least gives that
      impression.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em><strong>Timely:</strong> A sketch can be provided when needed.</em>
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Inexpensive:</strong> A sketch is cheap. Cost must not inhibit
      the ability to explore a concept, especially early in the design
      process.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Disposable:</strong> If you can't afford to throw it away when
      done, it is probably not a sketch. The investment with a sketch is in the
      concept, not the execution. By the way, this doesn't mean that they have
      no value, or that you always dispose of them. Rather, their value largely
      depends on their disposability.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Plentiful:</strong> Sketches tend not to exist in isolation.
      Their meaning or relevance is generally in the context of a collection or
      series, not as an isolated rendering.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Clear vocabulary:</strong> The style in which a sketch is
      rendered follows certain conventions that distinguish it from other types
      of renderings. The style, or form, signals that it is a sketch. The way
      that lines extend through endpoints is an example of such a convention, or
      style.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Distinct gesture:</strong> There is a fluidity to sketches that
      gives them a sense of openness and freedom. They are not tight and
      precise, in the sense that an engineering drawing would be, for
      example.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Minimal detail:</strong> Include only what is required to render
      the intended purpose or concept. Lawson (1997, p. 242) puts it this way,
      &quot;... it is usually helpful if the drawing does not show or suggest
      answers to questions which are not being asked at the time.&quot;
      Superfluous detail is almost always distracting, at best, no matter how
      attractive or well rendered. Going beyond &quot;good enough&quot; is a
      negative, not a positive.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Appropriate degree of refinement:</strong> By its resolution or
      style, a sketch should not suggest a level of refinement beyond that of
      the project being depicted. As Lawson expresses it: &quot;... it seems
      helpful if the drawing suggests only a level of precision which
      corresponds to the level of certainty in the designer's mind at the
      time.&quot;</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Suggest and explore rather than confirm:</strong> More on this
      later, but sketches don't &quot;tell&quot;, they &quot;suggest&quot;.
      Their value lies not in the artifact of the sketch itself, but in its
      ability to provide a catalyst to the desired and appropriate behaviours,
      conversations, and interactions.</em
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <em
      ><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Sketches are intentionally ambiguous, and
      much of their value derives from their being able to be interpreted in
      different ways, and new relationships seen within them, even by the person
      who drew them.</em

</ol>

<p>
  Point #9 above states that sketches should exhibit an appropriate degree of
  refinement, a point echoed in a post I made a while back on
  <a
    href="/posts/2006/10-26-matching-design-sketches-to-the-desired-level-of-design-feedback.html"
    >matching design sketches to the desired level of design feedback</a
  >. I found the other attributes listed here interesting food for thought.
