  A user interface designer, like a journalist, should avoid
  <em
    ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bury_the_lead"
      >burying the lede</a
    ></em
  >: engaging the user with an opening question or statement that omits the most
  critical point of interest. The
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_style#Terms_and_structure">lede</a>
  is the all-important opening sentence of a news story, and journalists labor
  over them. User interface interactions have ledes too, and they should be
  crafted with as much care.
</p>
<p>
  The Move File dialog in Windows Vista offers a convenient example. (Although a
  dialog is used here, this principle applies equally well to web pages or other
  UI modalities.) The Move File dialog appears when a user attempts to move a
  file into a folder that already contains a file of the same name:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/image_thumb_1.png" />
</p>
<p>Can you see the disaster in progress? Most users can't either.</p>
<p>
  This dialog has buried the lede. It focuses the user's attention on the fact
  that there is another file with the same name in the destination folder. It
  fails to point out a much, much more interesting condition:
  <strong
    >The user is about to overwrite a newer file with an older file.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  To its credit, this Move File dialog does improve upon the older File Replace
  dialog in previous versions of Windows: it offers more details that can help
  the user make a decision, and offers a new option to keep both files. (The
  latter is particularly helpful when dealing with files like auto-named digital
  photos, because a user can easily take different photos that end up with the
  same name.)
</p>
<p>
  Overwriting a file is not, by itself, an uncommon or bad thing. It is a daily
  occurrence for users to overwrite an older file with a newer version of that
  same file. The user may be posting an updated copy of a document to a backup
  location, or to a server for use by others, or to removable media for
  transportation elsewhere, etc. This is business as usual.
</p>
<p>
  Going the other way—overwriting a newer file with an older files—is a much
  rarer event. The user might be giving up on work they've done and throwing it
  away. Alternatively, they could be restoring a backup file to replace one that
  has become corrupted. Either event is unusual, a point which should be
  emphasized in the dialog.
</p>
<p>
  The above dialog's text fails at this, as does its layout and typography.
  There are numerous pieces of text competing for attention, but among the most
  prominent are the bolded file names. That's a bit odd, since the entire
  premise of the dialog is that <em>these two file names will be the same</em>.
  The dialog has carefully drawn the user's attention to information which is
  guaranteed to be redundant. (If the user is moving multiple files, only some
  of which have conflicts, the file names are relevant—but that case can and
  should be handled specially.)
</p>
<p>
  As just a very first cut at revising the above dialog to restore the lede,
  some text could change. The typography could be tweaked to focus on the
  salient time stamps. A different sound is probably also in order, to
  distinguish the invocation of this dialog variant from the more normal one
  above, and emphasize that something unusual is going on.

</p>
<p>
  (It should be pointed out that the designers of Vista's Win32-based UI can't
  actually set a run of text in bold, as shown in the dialog's introductory
  statement, because Win32 is
  <a href="/posts/2006/05-09-font-impoverished.html">font impoverished</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  This revision would clearly needs a ton more work, but is a start in the right
  direction. At least the dialog now opens with the lede.
