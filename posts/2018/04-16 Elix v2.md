Two months after releasing version 1.0 of [Elix](/elix), we're happy to announce version 2.0.

The main focus of this release is a [new paradigm for customizing components](/blog/posts/customizing-custom-elements-with-custom-elements) in which complex component can expose internal elements as configurable properties. You can control the appearance and behavior of such a complex component by handing it _other_ components it will use internally to fill various roles.

This paradigm lets us unify components that had previously been distinct, implementing them with reusable, shared code. For example, by default the Elix [Carousel](https://component.kitchen/elix/Carousel) shows little dots along the bottom:

<figure>
  <a href="https://component.kitchen/demos/carousel.html">
    <img src="/images/ck/Carousel.png">
  </a>
  <figcaption>(Tap/click for live demo)</figcaption>
</figure>

We can override those dots and tell the carousel component to use thumbnails for that role instead, producing a new [CarouselWithThumbnails](https://component.kitchen/elix/CarouselWithThumbnails) component:

<figure>
  <a href="https://component.kitchen/demos/carouselWithThumbnails.html">
    <img src="/images/ck/CarouselWithThumbnails.png">
  </a>
</figure>

As another example, the Elix [Tabs](https://component.kitchen/elix/Tabs) supplies a default style with a classic rounded tab look:

<figure>
  <a href="https://component.kitchen/demos/tabs.html">
    <img src="/images/ck/Tabs.png">
  </a>
</figure>

It's easy enough to supply a custom button to fill that same tab button role, as in this `Tabs` instance used as the organizing navigation element in a mobile app:

<figure>
  <a href="https://component.kitchen/demos/toolbarTabs.html">
    <img src="/images/ck/ToolbarTabs.png">
  </a>
</figure>

If you click the image through to the live demo, you'll see that the main "stage" element for this navigation UI has also been changed. `Tabs` has a main stage that shows a single tab panel at a time. By default, `Tabs` uses a simple [Modes](https://component.kitchen/elix/Modes) component as its stage. But this stage can be replaced with another element like [SlidingStage](https://component.kitchen/elix/SlidingStage), which not only adds a sliding transition, but also support for touch/trackpad gestures to move between tabs.

That's a level of customization far beyond what's feasible in CSS. By using one custom element as a parameter to another, we can efficiently create different expressions of fundamental UI patterns.

But as we built Elix 2.0, we realized we could take this idea of customization through custom elements as parameters a lot further.

## The mind-blowing part

When viewed at the right level of abstraction, _all_ of the component examples shown above _are the same component_. These carousels and tabbed UIs don't look alike, but at a logical level, these UI patterns both share core behavior:

- Both present a main stage showing a single item (an image or tab panel) at a time.
- Both present a list of smaller proxies for those items (dots/thumbnails or tab buttons) that can be clicked to select the corresponding item on the main stage.
- Both can be implemented so that they can generate a default set of such proxy elements for each corresponding item (i.e., a default dot/thumbnail for each image/panel).

All of those parts — the stage, the list of proxy elements, the proxy elements themselves — are configurable via properties.

By separating logical roles and relationships from particular DOM representations, we can find new opportunties to efficiently reuse code. Elix 2.0 delivers the shared behavior for the UI patterns above in a new component called [Explorer](https://component.kitchen/elix/Explorer). That can be configured on a per-element basis, or subclassed to bake the customizations in, as with the component classes showcased above.

We've applied the same configuration paradigm to the Elix set of overlay elements, so that [Dialog](https://component.kitchen/elix/Dialog), [Drawer](https://component.kitchen/elix/Drawer), and [Popup](https://component.kitchen/elix/Popup) are all built around a configurable [Overlay](https://component.kitchen/elix/Overlay) core. We expect we'll find opportunities to use this same pattern in many other places.

Building components around extensively configurable components like this means we can handle subtleties like accessibility and keyboard support in a consistent way, allowing us to deliver a higher-quality and more usable result. It also means that you can readily adapt Elix components for the unique needs of your application, including extensive possibilities for branding.
