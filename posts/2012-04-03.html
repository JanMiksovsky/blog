  The history of user interface design isn’t terribly long, but it’s long enough
  that designers who ignore it do so at their users’ peril. In the transition
  from clients apps to the web, a lot of UI history has been forgotten, ignored,
  or reluctantly set aside because its lessons were too expensive (if not
  impossible) to preserve in early browsers.
</p>
<p>
  For example, it’s hard to find a web application with a menu bar as usable as
  the standard system menu bars in OS/X and Windows. Consider the basic tasks of
  opening and closing a menu in a menu bar. Last week’s
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2012/03/popup.html"
    >post on popups</a
  >
  listed a number of ways in which a user can cancel a menu: clicking outside of
  it (while <em>not</em> accidentally triggering whatever one clicks on),
  pressing Escape, resizing the window, scrolling, or moving the focus to a
  different window. Web implementations often overlook these aspects of closing
  a menu.
</p>
<p>
  If we now turn our attention to the task of <em>opening</em> a menu, we find
  most web apps give this basic act similarly blunt treatment. The choices
  you’ll typically see in web menus are one of these:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Menus open when the user <strong>clicks</strong> on a menu title.<strong
    > </strong>This is straightforward for a single menu, but problematic in a
    menu bar with multiple menus. Users need to scan a set of menus if they’re
    exploring their options, or if they’re hunting for a particular command. In
    these situations, having to click on each menu in turn feels clunky. And if
    the menu developer has done the fundamentally right thing in absorbing mouse
    clicks outside the menu (so the user doesn&#39;t accidentally trigger
    something when canceling the menu), the user must click <em>twice</em> to
    open up the next menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Menus open as soon as the user <strong>hovers</strong> over a menu title.
    This feels responsive, and lets the user quickly scan a set of menus. On the
    downside, it can be incredibly distracting to have menus pop open when
    they’re unwanted. Consider a user who clicks in a text field, and then has
    to move the cursor away from the text field because the cursor doesn’t
    automatically disappear when they start typing.
    <em>(Another bit of UI history that’s been forgotten!)</em> Knocking the
    mouse out of the way, the user happens to end up parking the cursor over the
    menu bar, and now a completely unwanted, giant
    <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mega-dropdown-menus.html"
      >mega menu</a
    >
    pops up, covering up their work surface. (That menu article suggests using
    careful timing to avoid irritating the user, but to me that seems like a
    band-aid on what’s fundamentally the wrong solution.) Open-on-hover does
    offer the ability to have a click on the menu title perform navigation, but
    as discussed in
    <a
      href="http://uxmovement.com/navigation/why-hover-menus-do-users-more-harm-than-good/"
      >Why Hover Menus Do Users More Harm Than Good</a
    >, users may not discover that they can click on the title like a link — if
    hovering into the title popped it up, then the user can easily conclude that
    the menu has already performed the only job it’s there for.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The odd thing is that a completely smooth way to finesse the problems of both
  these methods is right in front of the designer and developer, in the very
  same OS/X and Windows client applications they are likely using to design or
  code one of these problematic approaches.
</p>
<p><strong>Key attributes of menu riffing behavior</strong></p>
<p>For ages both OS/X and Windows have used the following menu behavior:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    When no menu is open, hovering over a menu title can provide hover feedback
    on the title (Windows does this), but does <em>not</em> pop up the menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicking a menu opens it. This required click prevents accidental menu
    invocation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once a menu is open, hovering into the title of another menu closes the
    previous menu and implicitly opens the new one. This lets the user quickly
    <em>riff</em> through a menu bar’s menus to familiarize themselves with
    their contents or to find a specific command.<br /><br /><em
      >[Update: A commenter correctly points out that client OSes actually open
      menus immediately on mouse&#0160;down, instead of waiting for mouse up.
      This makes it possible to riff through menus with the mouse down. If I
      recall, Mac OS menus originally only worked on mouse down; letting go of
      the mouse while over a menu title closed the menu. Windows, in contrast,
      would keep the menu open even after the user released the mouse button,
      which was easier to use. The user didn&#39;t have to hold the mouse down
      throughout the whole menu exploration and command selection operation.
      This approach was eventually adopted by the Mac OS. But both Windows and
      OS/X still support mouse down opening and riffing of menus.]</em
    >
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To me, this resolution seems about perfect, and I wish all web app menus
  worked this way. In contrast, how often have you used one of the clunky
  always-click-to-open or twitchy open-on-hover web menu implementations and
  said to yourself, “I wish all my OS/X (or Windows) apps worked this way!”?
</p>
<p>
  To be fair, simply knowing the UI history (or being very observant) isn’t
  enough — there’s still the question of cost. One could argue that Apple and
  Microsoft have greater control over the environment than a web site within the
  constraints of the browser, which is true, but I think that explanation falls
  short. The fundamental problem seems to be the economics of homegrown UI: for
  most companies, it’s hard to justify the return on investment to get these
  details right in order to make a really usable menu bar. (Which, if they get
  it right, their users won’t even notice.) Apple and Microsoft can each build a
  perfect menu bar once that many developers can benefit from, so it’s worth
  their taking the time to get it right.
</p>
<p>
  Google Docs is one web app that has taken the time to sweat the details. Their
  document editing suite carefully follows the same menu riffing behavior
  described above: you open the first menu with a click, and subsequent menus
  with hover:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e20168e9741623970c-pi"
    ><img src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201676472dce5970b-pi.png"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  I’m not sure if Google acquired this finely-tuned menu through Writely or one
  of the other predecessors to Google Docs, or if they’ve more recently decided
  that a good way to displace with Microsoft Office is with great usability at a
  much cheaper price. Either way, it’s details like this that make Google Docs
  feels like such a reasonable replacement for a desktop application suite.
  (Thought not perfect yet: Google Docs gets the menu open behavior right, but
  gets points off for menu <em>closing</em> behavior because they don’t absorb
  background mouse clicks. And, as referenced above, it doesn’t hide the mouse
  when you start to type, the way most client text editors or word processors
  do.)
</p>
<p><strong>MenuBar control</strong></p>
<p>
  I’ve added a <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/MenuBar">MenuBar</a> control
  to the QuickUI Catalog, along with the usual companions of
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/Menu">Menu</a>,
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/MenuItem">MenuItem</a>, and
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/MenuSeparator">MenuSeparator</a> classes.
  A Menu can be used on its own, or as part of a MenuBar. When placed inside a
  MenuBar, the menus will exhibit the riffing behavior described above.
</p>
<p>
  I like the way Google’s visual style puts both the menu title and an open menu
  on the same seamless surface to visually connect the two regions, so I’ve used
  that style for a Menu’s generic appearance (the one you get if you don’t want
  to do any of your own styling).
</p>
<p>
  Although the MenuItem and MenuSeparator classes assume a traditional
  vertically-oriented list of commands, use of those classes isn’t required, and
  the Menu class could just as easily be used to present commands in multiple
  columns or any other arrangement.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>
<p>
  The tricky bit here was making the entire MenuBar and its menus accessible to
  the mouse, while simultaneously absorbing any background mouse click outside
  the menu bar or its menus. By default, an individual Menu control supplies its
  own Overlay so that a Menu can be used on its own or in some other menu
  bar-like UI construct. The problem is that an Overlay behind a single Menu
  control will prevent the user from hovering into other menus in the menu bar.
  So the MenuBar creates its own
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/Overlay">Overlay</a> control, and turns
  off the Overlays of the individual Menu controls. The result is the entire
  menu bar and its menus sit above a shared overlay. The user can hover from one
  menu to the next, and any clicks on the background overlay are absorbed and
  cancel the currently-opened menu.
</p>
<p>
  As always, it’s my hope that delivering this behavior in an open, reusable
  component can eventually change the economics of web usability so that anyone
  can benefit from the UI design history baked into a component — whether they
  realize that history is there or not.
