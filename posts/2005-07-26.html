  Microsoft Outlook, a dyed-in-the-wool client app, makes very effective use of
  a certain UI technique that comes up more often on web sites: whenever Outlook
  has additional information to communicate to the user, it does so in a
  modeless way by making room for the information in the window the user is
  working in.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you're scheduling an appointment over a time interval that
  contains other appointments, Outlook lets you know in a status area near the
  top of the main appointment window:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/images/flowstate/outlook_appointment_status_1.png"
    ><img
      src="/images/flowstate/outlook_appointment_status_1.png"
      alt="Outlook_appointment_status_1"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>
  The &quot;Conflicts with another appointment&quot; message works so well
  because the information, which is clearly salient to the current situation, is
  delivered in a modeless way. A less thoughtfully designed client app would pop
  up a modal dialog to communicate the same information, getting in the way of
  the user and forcing them to dismiss the dialog before they could fix the
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  That web sites handle feedback modelessly is taken for granted. Virtually all
  feedback regarding field validation in a web form is dealt with this way,
  typically as red text adjacent to the fields that require re-entry. A Win32
  application like Outlook has to do more work than a web site to achieve the
  same effect, because Win32's facilities for layout are so primitive that the
  designers and developers have to handle all the layout themselves.
  Nevertheless, this isn't rocket science, and the technique is so useful that
  more app designers should consider adopting it.
