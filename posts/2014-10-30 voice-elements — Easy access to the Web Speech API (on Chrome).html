<p>
  The voice-elements component gives you easy access to the Web Speech API
  natively supported (as of this writing) only in Chrome. This lets you both
  read text aloud to the user, and perform basic voice recognition. Users can
  quickly tire of repetitive spoken prompts, but voice playback might useful for
  short alerts that incorporate dynamic content such as data coming from your
  app.

  <strong>Likes:</strong>
  This supports multiple accents!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dislikes:</strong>
  None of the other browsers — Firefox, Safari, and IE — currently support the
  Web Speech API. We still think components like this are an important
  indication of the sort of power that components can put in anyone's hand.
