  Continuing a discussion of
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2007/10/show-mercy-to-k.html"
    >keyboard navigation</a
  >, it's worth asking whether the Tab navigation model itself is a problem that
  needs fixing. The Tab model works well in the small dialogs for which it was
  designed, but has completely failed to scale up to navigating complex web
  sites. Consider two user interfaces, one old and one contemporary:
</p>

    ><img

      src="/images/flowstate/windows_95_dialup_networking.png"
      title="Windows_95_dialup_networking"
      alt="Windows_95_dialup_networking" /></a
  ><br /><em>Windows 95 dialog with approximately 10 focusable controls</em
  >&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/images/flowstate/2007/11/08/msn_home_page.png"
    ><img
      width="490"
      height="728"
      border="0"
      alt="Msn_home_page"
      title="Msn_home_page"
      src="/images/flowstate/msn_home_page.png"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Default MSN.com home page with approximately 200 focusable controls</em>
</p>
<p>
  Note that
  <strong>the relative scale of these two screens has been preserved</strong>.
  Both spatially and logically, the user has a much, much larger area to move
  around.
</p>
<p>
  Modern operating system UIs provide two standard mechanisms for moving the
  focus around a window using the keyboard: a linear Tab model, and explicit
  keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Alt keys). The Tab model is the most commonly used
  for moving between fields in a UI. It evolved from a UI intended for
  navigating through the modest collection of input fields that could fit on
  small character-based display (with, for example, 24 rows of 80 characters),
  and represented an evolution in turn from Tab keys on typewriters. The Tab
  model hasn't evolved much since the character-based days. A single control in
  the active window has the keyboard focus. This control indicates its active
  state in one of several ways: button-like controls and list boxes show a
  dotted marquis or other highlighting effect, while text controls show an
  insertion point or selection. Pressing the Tab key moves the keyboard focus
  through the focusable (interactive) controls on the page in a linear order
  defined at design time by the programmer. Pressing Shift+Tab moves the focus
  through that order in reverse.
</p>
<p>
  That the Tab model was adequate for simple dialogs like the one above is
  evidenced by the model's survival over decades of change in UIs. To my mind
  this model has completely broken down, however, in its application to typical
  web pages. The first issue is one of scale: the page above has
  <strong>twenty times</strong> the number of focusable controls as the simple
  dialog. A user trying to use the keyboard to reach a link in the middle of the
  page might have to press the Tab key 125 times to reach it. (Or, if they were
  exceptionally efficient, they could tab around the other direction and only
  have to press Shift+Tab 75 times.) The second issue is that the page has a
  much more complex two-dimensional columnar layout that the dialog, but that
  layout cannot be captured in the one-dimensional tab order. To the user, the
  behavior of the Tab key is therefore quite unpredictable.
</p>
<p>
  The other standard keyboard navigation technique—explicit keyboard
  shortcuts—are also inadequate for complex user interfaces. Microsoft Windows
  allows users to move the focus directly to a control on the dialog by pressing
  a keyboard shortcut, generally the Alt key plus a single letter in the
  control’s label. (OS/X does this too, although I find it less discoverable and
  generally weaker in execution.) This system is workable for dialogs with a
  small number of controls and a reasonable distribution of letter frequencies
  in control labels, but is obviously unable to scale well beyond a handful of
  controls. (I remember once running out of available letters in a large dialog
  and having to resort to using the label's trailing colon as the shortcut
  character.)<br />
</p>
<p>
  The leading web browsers have adopted these legacy keyboard navigation
  techniques despite their inadequacy to scale up to modern web-based UIs.
  Mozilla Firefox, for its part, does offer one more keyboard navigation
  technique: Emacs-style incremental searching. This lets the user move the
  focus to a specific link by typing the apostrophe ('), or to specific text by
  typing a slash (/), then typing the initial text of the desired target. This
  is quite fast, although I personally find this method less than satisfying. I
  find it less brain-taxing to just point at the thing I want instead of having
  to read it and type it. I also have trouble keeping straight the three
  different keys for the three slightly different kinds of search Firefox offers
  for searching within a single page. In practice this UI doesn't work well for
  long scrolling pages: you need to be able to see the thing you want. Once you
  start typing and move the focus somewhere, you can't easily move the focus to
  an adjacent element without starting over or falling back to tabbing. The
  incremental search mechanism can't target controls other than textual links,
  and then only if the link text is unique. A substantial number of links are
  images, and don't even have visible text. And finally, because the keyboard
  shortcuts are unmodified by a key like Ctrl, they don't work if the keyboard
  focus is already in a text box.
</p>
<p>
  Interestingly, a much better user interface for navigating screens with lots
  of elements is already ubiquitous—but not on PCs. It's found on mobile phone
  web browsers, which of necessity do a good job at keyboard navigation. They
  support two-dimensional directional navigation by using Left, Right, Up and
  Down arrow keys (or a joystick) to move to the &quot;nearest&quot; element in
  the corresponding direction. For example, if you press the Right key,
  heuristics determine whether there's an element you might be trying to reach
  towards the right, and if there are multiple elements, which element you
  probably want.
</p>
<p>
  Significantly, these heuristics
  <strong>respect the rendered visual representation of the page</strong>, not
  the structure of the document's object model or the original location of
  elements at design time. This is necessary to account for the fact that the
  user may be viewing the page at a different width than the designer used, with
  different fonts, at different sizes, etc. Directional navigation UIs also
  tightly connect keyboard focus and scroll position, allowing someone to
  continually press the Up and Down keys to move through focusable controls
  <em>and</em> to page over large blocks of text.
</p>
<p>
  The first time I saw a directional navigation UI was actually in the original
  WebTV browser, later acquired by Microsoft and rebranded as MSN TV. I was
  inspired by that UI to push for inclusion of directional navigation support in
  Windows Presenation Foundation (&quot;Avalon&quot;), and was happy to hear
  that that work eventually saw the light of day in the .NET 3.0 release. (I
  haven't played with the final result myself, but my understanding is that you
  can turn it on or off for a page via its DirectionalNavigation property. I'm
  not sure if that feature made it into Silverlight.)
</p>
<p>
  Directional navigation works so well on mobile devices, I'm hoping it will get
  built into a browser someday. To avoid conflict with the existing semantics of
  arrow keys, the final UI could optionally support a keyboard modifier like
  Ctrl. (So that, e.g., Ctrl+Left means move the focus to the
  &quot;nearest&quot; control to the left). Microsoft has already filed for a
  patent on the very elegant heuristics in the WPF DirectionalNavigation
  feature, so it would make a natural addition to a future version of Internet
  Explorer. I'd love to see a similar approach adopted by Firefox, or at least
  developed as a Firefox add-on.
