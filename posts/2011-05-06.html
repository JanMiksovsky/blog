  Probably the most painful experience I have on a regular basis in my
  professional life is watching usability studies. Last year I became a big fan
  of <a href="http://www.usertesting.com">UserTesting.com</a> for conducting
  remote, unmoderated usability studies. In my experience, it’s been
  ridiculously fast, highly informative, and very inexpensive. Years ago I could
  only experience the agony of watching a floundering user by sitting behind a
  one-way mirror in a very expensive usability research lab. Now I can recapture
  that agony for only $39.
</p>
<p>
  The most painful aspect of watching a usability study is seeing a
  well-intentioned UI — one you were sure would be a success — actually cause a
  user emotional distress. But the <em>second</em> most painful aspect of
  watching a usability study is seeing a user successfully accomplish a task in
  10 steps which they could have accomplished in two. For example:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A user wants to copy and paste a word. They carefully mouse down at the
    beginning of the word, slowly drag across the word, then let go. They move
    their mouse waaaay up to the Edit menu, click, then slowly read down the
    list of menu items until they come to “Copy”. They select Copy. Whew,
    they’re halfway there. They reorient themselves, and then click where they
    want to paste the word. They move their mouse waaaay back up to the Edit
    menu, click, then slowly read down the list of menu items until they come to
    “Paste”. Click. Voilà! <br />

          display: inline;
          padding-top: 0px;
          border: 0px;
        "

    /></a>
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    A user wants to move a window. They drag the upper-left corner of the window
    to a new location. They then drag the lower-right corner of the window to a
    new location, taking care to make sure the window is now roughly the same
    size it was before.
  </li>
  <li>
    A user wants to browse to a URL. They click their browser’s Home button to
    return to a page that has a Google search box. They type the URL into the
    Google search box, then click Search. Google displays a long page of results
    (with ads!). The user finds a link to the desired URL at the top and clicks
    it.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  It’s impossible to watch these events and not want to rush in and tell the
  user about how to use keyboard shortcuts, drag a window’s title bar, type in
  the address bar. Hey, user, you could be <em>so much more efficient! </em>This
  instinct, while natural, and somewhat altruistic, also has at its core some
  compulsive behavior. Software developers obsess a bit about
  <a
    href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/11/whitespace-the-silent-killer.html"
    >Whitespace, The Silent Killer</a
  >. Software designers obsess a bit about user inefficiency.
</p>
<p>
  To be clear, being on the lookout for such inefficiencies is an absolutely
  critical design skill, as is being able to iterate towards a design that’s
  more likely to encourage efficient behavior. It’s worth asking, however: if
  the user got what they wanted, and is satisfied with the time and energy they
  spent, why should the fact that they ignored a more efficient route have to be
  troubling?
</p>
<p>
  Changing a design—even for the better—has its own costs: the designer’s, the
  engineer’s, the tester’s, the support staff’s, not to mention the existing
  users’ time to learn something new. And sometimes a blunt attempt to
  force-train the user a more efficient path is worse than the original problem.
  (Remember all those “Tip of the day” dialogs that used to pop up on
  application startup to tell you all about a keyboard shortcut the app’s
  designers thought you really should know?)
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, however, it’s best to leave well enough alone. It can be enough to
  rely on the user’s ability to follow the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_scent#Information_scent"
    >information scent</a
  >&#0160;down a path that’s circuitous, long — and successful. If a feature’s
  design is generally letting users accomplish their goals, you probably have
  more urgent design priorities to address.
</p>
<p>
  I’m always interested in hearing cases like this, where a user followed a
  circuitous but ultimately successful path. What’s the most extreme case of
  this you’ve seen?
