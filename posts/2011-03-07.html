<p>
  Is anyone else bothered by photo thumbnails that are smaller than they need to
  be?

    >The window above leaves plenty of empty space that could be better utilized
    to show the photos in more detail. Sure, there’s a Zoom slider in the
    toolbar, and I could fiddle with it to find the best zoom level that shows
    all the photos at the largest thumbnail size without forcing the appearance
    of scroll bars. One problem is that this zoom level applies to
    <em>all</em> photo albums, regardless of how many photos a given album has,
    so I have to keep fiddling with it to get the best results for any one
    album. When I switch to a different album with a different number of photos,
    I end up playing with the Zoom again until I’ve got the thumbnails at the
    biggest size that still lets them all fit. Another problem is that, if I
    change the window size at all, I have to play with Zoom yet again.</span

  <span style="font-size: small"
    >Virtually all photos apps, including OSes that display photos, work this
    way. Perhaps we’ve had manual Zoom sliders for so long we haven’t
    reconsidered their shortcomings. To me they feel cumbersome—like they’re
    making me do work the app should be able to do on its own. If I can manually
    fiddle with the Zoom slider to make the photos as big as possible and still
    fit all of them (or a good number of them), why can’t the app adjust the
    zoom level for me?</span

<p>
  <span style="font-size: small"
    >Perhaps the standard Zoom slider is a vestige of a time when dynamically
    scaling photos was slow, so apps (and users) didn’t want to do it that
    often. That’s no longer the case; CPUs and GPUs are such that photo scaling
    just screams these days. </span
  ><span style="font-size: small"
    >In many situations, and especially for small albums, I think a user would
    prefer to see the photos at the biggest possible size, to make effective use
    of their window real estate. This might not be the case for every user or
    for every app, but surely this would be useful in many cases.</span

  <span style="font-size: small"
    >An interesting question is: given an arbitrary canvas size, and a
    collection of <em>n</em> photos with various aspect ratios, how big can
    those photos be shown and still have them all fit? </span
  ><span style="font-size: small"
    >This turns out to be an issue of how to best divide the screen into
    squares. Squares are generally used to display thumbnails to account for the
    fact that photos have different aspect ratios. The bigger the square given
    to each thumbnail, the bigger the average rendered thumbnail can be. So the
    real question becomes: what grid dimensions (number of rows and columns)
    will divide the canvas into the biggest squares?</span

<p>
  <span style="font-size: small"
    >This line of thinking led to an algorithm I call MaxSquare which calculates
    the optimal grid size for a collection of <em>n</em> images such that each
    image is allocated the largest possible square cell. It seems to work well,
    and I’d love to see it find some real use.</span

      trouble retrieving the sample photos from Flickr.)</span

    >Once you’ve opened the demo, resize the browser window to see the photos
    automatically zoomed to use the available space. You can also adjust the
    “count” parameter on the URL to view a smaller or larger number of photos.
    E.g., enter count=24, and as you resize the browser, you can watch the
    column and row dimensions jump between the various factor pairs of 24 (8x3,
    6x4, etc.).</span

    fact, maybe <em>that’s</em> the right use for a Zoom slider: to pick the
    <em>minimum</em> thumbnail size which the user finds acceptable.</span
