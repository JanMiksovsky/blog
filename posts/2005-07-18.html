  I recently played with two photo slideshow sharing products:
  <a href="http://www.hello.com">Picasa Hello</a> and MSN Photo Swap (part of
  <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/">MSN Messenger</a> version 7). These two
  products both give people a way to show someone else photos over the net, but
  their UIs reveal subtle distinctions between their user models for this task.
</p>
<p>
  The most interesting distinction for me comes up in the UI for determining
  who's showing photos and who's watching photos. Hello's model allows for
  free-form interaction between the participants. If you want to look at a
  specific photo, you can. If you want to let your buddy drive the action, you
  click a command called &quot;Follow Friend&quot;:
</p>
<p>

    title="Picasa_hello"
    alt="Picasa_hello"
  />
</p>
<p>
  You can see which photo your friend is looking at and -- if they want to
  follow your lead -- they can elect to follow along with you. In practice, this
  model and the resulting UI feels natural.
</p>
<p>
  MSN Photo Swap, meanwhile, feels like what you'd get if you shared photos
  according to Robert's Rules of Order. One user has the floor, so to speak, and
  gets to hold on to it for as long as they want. When they see fit to cede
  control to someone else, they click a &quot;Pass Control&quot; command:
</p>
<p>
  <img

    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/msn_photo_swap.png"
    title="Msn_photo_swap"
    alt="Msn_photo_swap"
  />
</p>
<p>
  In practice, this model makes what should be a pleasant experience between
  friends feel dull. If I don't want to look at the photo my buddy is showing,
  I'm stuck. (Where is the &quot;Filibuster&quot; command?)
</p>
<p>
  The rest of Picasa Hello's UI is likewise friendlier than that in MSN Photo
  Swap -- but the UI is moot. Hello is probably doomed as a standalone
  application.
</p>
<p>
  Photo slideshow sharing is a feature, not a product. It only makes sense in
  the context of a larger framework for interaction over the net such as an IM
  client like MSN Messenger. I can't imagine telling someone that I want to show
  them some photos I took, but first they should download and install a client
  app that they'll never use for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
  Here's hoping Picasa Hello gets incorporated into something bigger, or that
  Photo Swap loosens up.
