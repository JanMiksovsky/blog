  At the beginning of January, I set myself a goal to see if I could make at
  least one post on flow|state a month. January&#39;s now over, with no post.
  I&#39;ve had a draft of the promised follow-up to the last post on the
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2008/10/the-shared-suff.html"
    >Shared Suffering Hypothesis</a
  >&#0160;under construction for three months. (Thanks to Michael, Barry, Evan,
  &amp; co. for their comments, the most interesting dialogue I&#39;ve received
  on a post in a long while.) I still&#0160;can&#39;t find the time to finish
  off the darn post.

        It&#39;s sinking in that helming a startup through a stormy economy
        while adequately parenting three young children just doesn&#39;t leave
        enough personal time to do this blog justice. FeedBurner says I&#39;ve
        got several thousand subscribers, and I&#39;ve occasionally run into
        readers who offered me their encouragement (thanks, John F.!). I would
        prefer not to leave them wondering why there&#39;s no activity.

        I need less stress, not more, right now, and think the safest thing to
        do is declare an indefinite blog hiatus. There are still countless UI
        topics on which I would like to write, and I hope at some point to find
        the time to get some down. At that point you—and I—can be pleasantly
        surprised. Until then, thanks for reading.
