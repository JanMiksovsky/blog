  Spring and summer have turned out to be the busiest time of the year for
  design at Cozi. The driving force behind this annual cycle is the Back to
  School period: when parents prepare their household for their children’s
  return to school from summer vacation. American schools traditionally started
  in September after Labor Day, but various forces have moved the start of
  school earlier, such that roughly half the school districts now have resumed
  by the middle of August. As part of their Back to School preparations, parents
  often reconsider the way they will manage their calendar—and the family’s
  calendar—during the coming school year. This presents a good opportunity for
  Cozi, and so we are often focused on delivering new features and improvements
  by early August.
</p>
<p>
  This year we’re making significant changes to the layout of the calendar page
  to make more room for the family’s calendar data, so they can take in more
  calendar information at a glance. Towards that end, there are a number of
  changes in the works. One change we just released today is a consolidation of
  various calendar commands into a single toolbar at the top of the page:

</p>
<p>
  Here we’ve merged three rows of user interface elements (the Week and Month
  buttons at the top, the appointment entry area at the bottom, and the row of
  buttons below that) into one. This buys us some vertical real estate, and lays
  groundwork for some future changes.
</p>
<p>
  A toolbar is a standard user interface design pattern, but applying this
  design here has still been interesting for several reasons. For one thing,
  it’s always interesting to me to see how UIs evolve over time.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We didn’t start with the proposition that we should have multiple places for
    commands. We started with the row of colored dots at the top, and the
    appointment entry area below.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then we needed a place to put a Print command, and later a Send to Phone
    command. They didn&#39;t fit anywhere else, so we created a new row for
    them.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added several other forms of Send to Phone, which evolved into a Phone
    menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    When we transitioned from a Windows application to the web, we changed the
    UI model for calendar views, and moved the Week and Month buttons to the
    top.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added the ability to sync with Outlook and subscribe to Internet
    calendars, necessitating more buttons.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added some more buttons to the appointment entry area. To keep things
    clean, those buttons are
    <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2008/06/transient-contr.html"
      >transient controls that only appear while typing</a
    >.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now we’re preparing to add some more features, which would have meant even
  more buttons. But by now the UI is reaching a tipping point where it begins to
  feel clunky, and so we’ve decided to simplify the UI by consolidating the
  controls into a toolbar.
</p>
<p>
  Many, many other UIs have passed through similar stages. In Stewart Brand’s
  book,

    >How Buildings Learn</a
  >, he describes a similar evolution of a house’s porch into a proper room:
</p>

<blockquote>
  “Porches fill in by stages, not all at once you know…. The family puts screens
  on the porch one summer because of bugs. Then they see they could glass it in
  and make it part of the house. But it&#39;s cold, so they add a duct from the
  furnace and some insulation, and now they realize they&#39;re going to have to
  beef up the foundation and the roof. It happens that way because they can
  always visualize the next stage based on what&#39;s already there.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  We’ve got more changes for the toolbar coming in the next couple of months.
  (And hopefully no bugs.)
