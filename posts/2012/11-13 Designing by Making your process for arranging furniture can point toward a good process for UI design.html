<p>
  The last time you had to arrange the furniture in your home — did you create a
  design first? No. You had a design <em>idea,</em> and then immediately jumped
  into implementing your idea by moving the sofa and table around until the
  result felt good.

  <br /><em><span>Hmm… let’s try putting this over here…</span></em>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Consider these attributes of the typical process for arranging furniture:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You do it yourself. If you have enough money, you might tell movers where to
    put the heavy things first, but you’re still directly involved, and you’ll
    end up pushing things around yourself before it’s all over.
  </li>
  <li>
    You work directly with the furniture and the space, without recourse to a
    single design artifact. Think about it: in the time it would take to create
    a scale model of a room and the furniture to sufficient accuracy that it
    could actually inform your decisions, you can finish the task of moving the
    real furniture into place.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can never predict whether a layout will completely work until you’ve
    actually gotten things in place. Once the pieces are in place, you
    <em>always</em> discover something unexpected. You move your desk so it
    faces the door, then sit in the desk chair and realize you can’t see the
    view out the window. So you turn the desk around to face the window, then
    get a creepy feeling that someone might sneak in the door and creep up
    behind you without your knowledge. Each layout you try teaches you
    something.
  </li>
  <li>
    The process is inherently iterative. You start with an idea, and iterate
    through various layouts until you converge on an acceptable result (or
    you’re tired of moving stuff around).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>You can design software user interfaces this way too.</p>
<p>
  I had a chance to speak about my own design process at a talk I gave last
  month at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, to an engaged
  audience of interesting students in the school’s MBA in Design Strategy
  program. There I discussed how my own design process has changed
  substantially&#0160;in the last five years to become something I might call
  designing by making. In this process, the design of a software experience is
  inseparable from the coding of that experience. In this regard, the process
  has a lot in common with arranging furniture.
</p>
<p>
  Many contemporary design process artifacts like field interviews, a wall of
  post-it notes, and paper prototypes reflect an increasingly antiquated
  premise: that building a real thing is much more expensive than producing a
  design. Historically, it has been true that designing software with a complex
  user interface was a minor cost compared to the labor of actually writing the
  code. In my early days at Microsoft, one might have seen a ratio of one
  designer to five to eight engineers (developers and testers), because even
  primitive tasks like obtaining user input or positioning interface controls in
  a window entailed such extensive, labor-intensive coding. It seemed sensible
  to invest considerable thought and time in the design phase because it could
  be many months before the designer would get to experience the actual product
  for the first time. Unfortunately, that moment of enlightenment often didn’t
  come until the fully-functional pre-beta builds arrived roughly two-thirds of
  the way through the product cycle. At that point, when the designer inevitably
  has new insights into the best design, any big design changes would often
  needed to be deferred until the next version.
</p>
<p>
  Much software is still designed this way, even though the economics of user
  interface implementation have changed radically. The effort required to create
  useful, functional, beautiful, reliable, and performant software application
  user interfaces has been dropping for years, and this trend will continue for
  the foreseeable future. About five years ago, the technology reached the point
  where it became possible for me to create web applications directly. Rather
  than working in Photoshop, Microsoft Word, or a prototyping tool as before,
  and handing these designs off to an engineer, I can now directly create the
  user interface design in code myself.
</p>
<p>
  This is roughly as expensive as the old way of doing things, but with the
  significant advance that I am now working with a functional artifact — a
  working user interface — from the very beginning. This turns out to be a
  transformative difference. Just as you can never predict all the ramifications
  of a particular furniture layout, you can never fully predict the strengths
  and weaknesses of a UI design.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, I currently believe it’s best to design something by making
  it.&#0160;This means it’s generally not worth a great deal of time to consider
  the hypothetical implications of a theoretical design. (“Will the user find
  this clear?”, “Will this meet the user’s needs?”) It’s faster to just build
  something that actually works, then immediately <em>observe</em>&#0160;whether
  it is good or not. Instead of viewing design as a predecessor to making, this
  is designing by making. The process looks just like the process above:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do both the design and coding yourself.</li>
  <li>
    Work directly in code, without recourse to other design artifacts. If you’re
    working with good tools, in the time it would take to create an accurate
    static image of what you want, with all the specs that would go along with
    that, you can instead create a functional design that actually does what you
    want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Know that you will be unable to predict whether a design will completely
    work until you actually having a working interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build your schedule around iteration. You start with an idea, and iterate
    through various approaches until you converge on an acceptable result (or
    you’re tired of moving stuff around).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This process isn’t for everyone. There are software domains that don’t entail
  a user interface (Mars landers, say), where a traditional, process-heavy
  design phase obviously holds true. And not all designers can code, nor can all
  coders design. But I believe that designing by making does allows someone who
  can do both well to iterate much faster from an idea to a usable interface
  than a designer who is forced to rely on someone else to write the code.
</p>
<p>
  I believe that in the near future, most software application design will look
  like this. The trends simplifying the coding of user interfaces will continue
  and accelerate, as better design/coding tools permit the construction of
  better design/coding tools.

    >Component-oriented user interface frameworks</a
  >
  will allow people to spend less time designing and coding the details of
  common patterns.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, companies with experience in creating tools like Adobe are now
  waking up to the realities of a post-Flash world, in which the open web is the
  real application platform to focus on. (Microsoft is also slowly waking up to
  the prospect of a post-Windows client world, although that change will take
  much longer, and I’m not sure they’ll be able to change fast enough to stay
  relevant.)&#0160;Generally speaking, I have high hopes for innovation in the
  realm of tools and frameworks, all of which should make it more and more
  practical for someone like you to do both the design and coding yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Today, it is already possible to have a design process built around coding
  that is as efficient — or, often, more efficient — than a traditional,
  artifact-heavy, pre-coding design process. What’s more, the tool chain will
  ultimately improve to the point where designing a user interface will be
  <em>as fast as arranging furniture</em>.&#0160;In the time it takes you to
  say, “Let’s try moving the bookcase over there”, and actually move the
  bookcase, you’ll be able to say, “Let’s try a tabbed navigation approach”, and
  actually switch a design to using tabbed navigation. Imagine what it will be
  like to design software like<em> that</em>.
