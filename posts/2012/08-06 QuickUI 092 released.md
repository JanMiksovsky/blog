<p>
  Version 0.9.2 is primarily a bug-fix release. Beyond a variety of minor fixes,
  there are just a couple of notable changes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Using $.control( element ) on an existing element to cast the element to the
    correct subclass of Control now returns null (instead of undefined) if the
    given element is not a control.
  </li>
  <li>
    A bug has been fixed which prevented quickui.js from loading in IE8. Thanks
    to QuickUI user Toussaint for reporting this bug and helping to test the
    fix!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The release of 0.9.2 coincides with the release of version 0.9.2 of the
  QuickUI Catalog, which includes the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Modes now derives from a new base class called Sequence, a general-purpose
    class for any linear sequence of elements that can be navigated via a next()
    and previous() method. Modes now focuses on showing just one element of a
    Sequence at a time. As part of this change, Modes.activeChild() has been
    renamed to Modes.activeElement().
  </li>
  <li>
    SlidingPages has been renamed SlidingPanels (since its contained elements
    aren’t necessarily pages). The class now also derives from Sequence.
    Finally, SlidingPanels has been updated to take advantage of CSS transitions
    on browsers that support them, falling back to a jQuery animation on older
    browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    LateralNavigator has been refactored to handle two general cases: first,
    navigating through a Sequence of elements, and second navigating through an
    abstract axis like time. The former case is specifically addressed with a
    new class called SequenceNavigator. The latter case is used in
    CalendarMonthNavigator.
  </li>
  <li>
    An issue that prevented CalendarMonthNavigator from correctly vertically
    aligning its heading elements has been fixed. CalendarMonthNavigator now
    also uses a new class, MonthAndYear, to show both the month and year instead
    of just the month name.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new VerticalAlign class handles the general problem of vertically aligning
    child elements in older browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new Carousel class derives from SequenceNavigator, and uses a
    SlidingPanels class to provide a sliding transition between elements in the
    sequence.
  </li>
  <li>The TabSet class has been renamed to Tabs.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This release is also notable as the first one in which Catalog controls have
  been written (and, some cases, rewritten) in CoffeeScript.
