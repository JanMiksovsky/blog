<p>
  Version 0.9.2 is primarily a bug-fix release. Beyond a variety of minor fixes,
  there are just a couple of notable changes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Using $.control( element ) on an existing element to cast the element to the
    correct subclass of Control now returns null (instead of undefined) if the
    given element is not a control.
  </li>
  <li>
    A bug has been fixed which prevented quickui.js from loading in IE8. Thanks
    to QuickUI user Toussaint for reporting this bug and helping to test the
    fix!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The release of 0.9.2 coincides with the release of version 0.9.2 of the
  QuickUI Catalog, which includes the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Modes now derives from a new base class called Sequence, a general-purpose
    class for any linear sequence of elements that can be navigated via a next()
    and previous() method. Modes now focuses on showing just one element of a
    Sequence at a time. As part of this change, Modes.activeChild() has been
    renamed to Modes.activeElement().
  </li>
  <li>
    SlidingPages has been renamed SlidingPanels (since its contained elements
    arenâ€™t necessarily pages). The class now also derives from Sequence.
    Finally, SlidingPanels has been updated to take advantage of CSS transitions
    on browsers that support them, falling back to a jQuery animation on older
    browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    LateralNavigator has been refactored to handle two general cases: first,
    navigating through a Sequence of elements, and second navigating through an
    abstract axis like time. The former case is specifically addressed with a
    new class called SequenceNavigator. The latter case is used in
    CalendarMonthNavigator.
  </li>
  <li>
    An issue that prevented CalendarMonthNavigator from correctly vertically
    aligning its heading elements has been fixed. CalendarMonthNavigator now
    also uses a new class, MonthAndYear, to show both the month and year instead
    of just the month name.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new VerticalAlign class handles the general problem of vertically aligning
    child elements in older browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new Carousel class derives from SequenceNavigator, and uses a
    SlidingPanels class to provide a sliding transition between elements in the
    sequence.
  </li>
  <li>The TabSet class has been renamed to Tabs.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This release is also notable as the first one in which Catalog controls have
  been written (and, some cases, rewritten) in CoffeeScript.
