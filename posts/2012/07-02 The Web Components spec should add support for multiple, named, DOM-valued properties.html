<p>
  At last week's Google I/O 2012 conference, Chrome engineers Alex Komoroske and
  Dimitri Glazkov gave a talk called, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2txPYQOWBtg"
    >The Web Platform’s Cutting Edge</a
  >, a good overview of Web Components and <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/#custom-element-section"
    >custom elements</a
  > in particular. The demo code shown in that presentation does point to an
  issue with the current Web Components spec that could seriously constrain the
  ease with which components can be written and shared. I’ll lay out the case
  here in hopes this problem can be fixed at an early stage.
</p>
<h2>But first: A word of appreciation</h2>
<p>
  Authoring a spec for a new standard like Web Components is generally a
  thankless task, as is the tireless work of promulgating the standard through
  presentations like the one at Google I/O. So, before saying anything else: a
  big
  <strong>Thank You</strong> to Alex and Dimitri for their work on HTML
  Templates, Custom Elements, and Shadow DOM. Everything which follows is meant
  to support your work, not put it down.
</p>
<h2>Background of the problem</h2>
<p>
  As I’ve blogged about before, I’m a passionate fan of web UI components and
  <a
    href="/posts/2012/03-14-like-snapping-together-a-skyscraper-web-components-will-catalyze-a-completely-new-ecosystem-for-creating-ui.html"
    >believe they will transform UI development</a
  >. The ability to define new elements for HTML is something designers and
  developers have long wanted but, until now, could only dream about. In the
  demo, Alex and Dimitri use Chrome’s early implementation of the proposed spec
  to create custom elements. They elegantly combine these elements to produce a
  custom UI component for a user poll:
</p>
<img
  src="/images/quickui/web-component-poll_thumb.png"
  alt="Web Component Poll"
/>
<p>
  This poll user interface is a large component comprised of sub-components for
  accordions (or, later in the demo, tabs) and the big iconic choice buttons in
  the poll for “Semantics”, “Offline &amp; Storage”, etc. All these components
  are defined with declarative markup.
</p>
<p>
  I enthusiastically agree with the presenters that declarative HTML, including
  the ability to define custom elements, results in UI code that can be easier
  to read than a comparable imperative solution in JavaScript. And to its
  credit, most of the demo code shown in the presentation is self-explanatory.
</p>
<p>
  However, one aspect of the code really jumped out at me as a serious
  limitation of the current spec: a component host can only pass a single DOM
  content subtree to the component. As I’ll try to show, I believe that could
  seriously limit the degree to which a component can expose a meaningful API.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the markup behind those big “choice” buttons. Each choice component
  includes an icon, a short text summary used as a label, and longer descriptive
  text that appears in a tooltip on hover. You can think of that per-choice data
  as, in effect, three public properties of the choice component:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;element name=”x-choice” extends=”div” constructor=”ChoiceControl”&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;
        &lt;div id=”choice”&gt;
            &lt;div id=”icon” class=”mask”&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;content select=”h3:first-of-type”&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
            &lt;aside&gt;
                &lt;content select=”*”&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
            &lt;/aside&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
    …
&lt;/element&gt;</pre
>
<p>
  The code above makes use of the proposed &lt;content&gt; element to select
  specific portions of the DOM tree (using CSS selectors) and incorporate them
  into the component’s shadow DOM. With that in place, the code for the overall
  poll component (i.e., the choice host) can instantiate choice buttons with the
  following markup:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;x-choice value=”semantics”&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Semantics&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving meaning to structure, semantics are front and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
&lt;x-choice value=”offline-storage”&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Offline &amp; Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web apps can start faster and work even if there is no…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
…</pre
>
<p>
  So the first code fragment effectively defines a choice component with three
  public properties (although these aren't actually class properties). The
  second code fragment shows the creation of two instances of that choice
  component, filling in two of the three choice properties. It’s not shown where
  the icon property is filled in, but it’s presumably done through styling.
</p>
<p>All looks fine so far, but there are some serious issues lurking here.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>
  The root issue here is that, as currently speced,
  <em
    >Web Components can only accept a single DOM-valued content property via
    markup</em
  >. This leads to a profusion of problems:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h2>
      Asking developers to tease apart component content will mean work for
      devs, and produce inconsistent results.
    </h2>
    Why, exactly, is the choice component using the &lt;h3&gt; tag to specify
    the text label for the button? Because this component has two textual
    properties, and the current Web Components spec only lets the developer pass
    <em>one</em> DOM content subtree to a component. So the component's author
    developer has to somehow let the component's users pack more than one
    property into the content, and then the dev has to crack that content to
    extract those properties. The question of <em>how</em> to crack that single
    content subtree into multiple properties is left entirely up to the
    developer. The tool given to the developer for this purpose is CSS
    selectors, which at first glance seems powerful. Unfortunately, it’s also a
    recipe for inconsistency. Every developer will have the freedom—and chore—to
    approach this problem their own way, guaranteeing the emergence of a handful
    of different strategies, plus a number of truly bizarre solutions. It’s as
    if you were programming in a system where functions could only accept a
    single array. As it turns out, we already have a good, common example of a
    such a system: command line applications. Every command-line application has
    some main() function that’s handed a single array of command line options,
    and the application has to decide what to do with them. Although conventions
    eventually arose with respect to the order and meaning of arguments, there’s
    still a wide variety of approaches. Some apps rely on argument position,
    some rely on single-letter flags (“-a”), some rely on full-word named
    parameters (“--verbose"), some have idiosyncratic microgrammars (e.g., chmod
    permissions), and many applications support a rich combination of all these
    approaches. Parsing arguments is tedious, boring work. In the early days, a
    developer throwing an app together might do the absolute minimum work
    necessary. The result was often inconsistent or incomplete argument support.
    The dev might eventually be forced to hack on their app until they finally
    had a roughly functional command line parser. These days, developers can
    rely on language features, or libraries like Python’s argparse, to “crack”
    the argument array into a meaningful structure which can be more easily
    inspected. In particular, it’s invaluable to a developer to be able to
    directly inspect specific arguments by <em>name</em>. The use of CSS
    selectors does remove some of this tedium, but it still leaves devs without
    a consistent way to refer to component properties by name, thereby leaving
    the door wide open for inconsistency. A dev might decide to use DOM
    structure, HTML tags, element classes, or a combination of all of these to
    demarcate properties. This will make it much harder for devs to share
    components, to swap out one component for another, and so on. It would be
    better if we could learn from the command-line argument example now and head
    off this inconsistency.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>
      HTML semantics are nearly meaningless when used to identify parameters.
    </h2>
    In the Google I/O demo, the developer of the choice component elected to use
    HTML tags within the single content subtree to identify properties. In this
    case, they decided that the first &lt;h3&gt; element in the content would
    identify the summary text, and everything else would be used as the longer
    text description. But why use &lt;h3&gt; for this purpose? The W3C <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/global.html#h-7.5.5"
      >spec</a
    >
    says a heading tag like &lt;h3&gt; should be used to, “briefly describe the
    topic of the section it introduces”. These choices aren't introducing
    sections, so that can't be the the case here. Neither is this &lt;h3&gt;
    being used to reflect the rank of an element in a hierarchical document
    structure. In all likelihood, the &lt;h3&gt; is used here, as it often is in
    practice, to mean something like, “somewhat prominent, but not
    <em>too</em> prominent”. Visually this usually translates to, “bold text, a
    little bigger than the body text”. At least, that seems to be how &lt;h3&gt;
    is being used in this component. There's nothing really wrong with that, but
    it's clearly arbitrary. Other developers might easily make a different
    decision. Later, in the very same demo, the code for the poll component
    accepts the text label for a different Voting button through the use of a
    &lt;label&gt; element. So in one place in this app, a button’s label is
    specified with an &lt;h3&gt;, but elsewhere <em>in the same app</em>, a
    button’s label is specified with a &lt;label&gt;. I don’t think this
    reflects any particular negligence on the part of the demo’s developers. I
    think it’s a latent issue in any scheme that relies on HTML elements for
    something than the original purpose. Perhaps the code' s developers did have
    some reason in mind for using &lt;label&gt; in one place and &lt;h3&gt; in
    another, but the point is that the reason is not obvious to another party
    looking at the code. The same arbitrary nature of tag choice here applies to
    use of the &lt;aside&gt; tag to identify the choice description. Try this:
    show the poll screen shot above to 3 web developers, and ask them which HTML
    tag they would use to specify the tooltip that should appear when the user
    mouses over a choice button. I’d be surprised if even <em>one</em> of them
    picked the &lt;aside&gt; tag. Is the tooltip content here really, as the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/aside">W3C description</a>
    says for the &lt;aside&gt; element, “tangentially related to the content
    around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that
    content”? Well, not really. But, maybe; that’s a debatable point. The fact
    it’s debatable is what’s at issue here. In contrast, here’s a tautological
    statement which <em>wouldn’t</em> generate debate: the choice description in
    the tooltip is the choice description in the tooltip. The
    <em>local</em> semantics here aren’t in question. So it’s a shame the
    property can’t be described in contextual terms like “description”, or
    “tooltip”. The fact that the component is using HTML elements to identify
    arguments appears sensible, but in practice will be nearly meaningless.
    Every single time a dev needs to create a new component property, they’ll
    pick from the 100-odd HTML elements. Their selection may depend on their
    experience, their mood, the phase of the moon, and which handful of HTML
    elements they haven’t already used for <em>other</em> properties on the same
    component. It's highly likely a different developer (or the same developer
    on a different day) would make a different selection of HTML elements for
    the same properties. Imagine an object-oriented programming language that
    forced you to give class properties one of 100 sanctioned property names:
    “index”, “count”, “name”, etc. Evereyone’s classes would
    <em>look</em> consistent, but it would be an utterly false consistency.
    That’s effectively what we’ll get if component authors are forced to choose
    HTML tags to identify component properties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>
      Use of CSS selectors hinders a developer’s ability to add new properties.
    </h2>
    Suppose the author of this component needs to add a new property to this
    choice component. Maybe they want to add a “More about this choice” link to
    each choice; this link should navigate to another page with more details on
    that poll choice. Following the example of the &lt;h3&gt; for the choice
    summary, they decide to define this link property by extracting the first
    &lt;a&gt; tag in the content to be the link to the “More about this choice”
    page. Perhaps, following their use of the “h3:first-of-type” selector above,
    they decide to pick out this &lt;a&gt; tag with the similar CSS selector
    “a:first-of-type”. If they do so, this component author will inadvertently
    screw up any component user who happened to include an &lt;a&gt; tag
    somewhere in the description. Suppose a user of this component has
    <em>already</em> created some code for a choice like this:
    <pre>
&lt;x-choice value=”semantics”&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Semantics&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Semantics in &lt;a href=”…”&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt; applications…
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;</pre
    >
    The “a:first-of-type” selector for the “More about this choice” link will
    accidentally pick up the existing link, thereby breaking this use of the
    component. The component author could issue a “Breaking Change” notice,
    warning everyone to include an &lt;a&gt; tag before the choice description.
    But even that wouldn’t help someone who, for whatever reason, needed to
    embed an &lt;a&gt; inside of the &lt;h3&gt;. The use of selectors here could
    be made more robust by using the child selector "&gt;", as in "&gt;
    h3:first-of-type". But this gets verbose, and again, isn't likely to be a
    universal convention, and inconsistent use of the child selector will only
    add to the confusion. The fundamental problem is that using CSS selectors
    for this purpose is inherently fragile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Arbitrary parameter structure is brittle.</h2>
    The fragility of using CSS selectors remains even if one tries to avoid the
    use of arbitrary HTML elements. Suppose you decide to use element
    <em>position </em>to identify components. You’ll still up a component which
    is hard to update. Here, a relevant case study is the existing of positional
    function parameters in most programming languages. To take just one example,
    consider JavaScript functions. Suppose you’ve defined a function with three
    parameters: “function foo(a, b, c) {…}”. If you now want to add a new
    parameter “d”, you have to add it to the end of the argument list to avoid
    breaking existing users of your function. This can easily produce a function
    whose parameter order feels unnatural. And to use the new “d” parameter, a
    function caller <em>must </em>supply the intermediate arguments a, b, and c,
    even if those are irrelevant to the function call at hand. To avoid these
    problems, programming languages tend to eventually evolve named function
    parameters. Functions with named parameters are inherently more future-proof
    and, importantly, allow callers to only specify the parameters they care
    about. The lesson of positional function parameters applies to trying to
    parse component properties out of the DOM content subtree. Having learned
    this lesson in countless programming languages, it would be nice to just
    jump straight to a reasonable solution which allowed for named component
    properties. While CSS selectors represent a powerful parsing tool, much of
    that power is completely unnecessary in this context — and some people will
    inevitably put that extra power to poor use.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h1>Subclasses will compete for parameters with their base classes.</h1>
    The above situations quickly deteriorate further when one envisions
    extending an existing component via subclassing. Subclassing is a crucial
    means of efficiency in component development, in which the behavior of one
    component can be specialized for new purposes. As just one case, over 33% of
    the controls in the
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</a> are subclasses of
    other Catalog controls. For example, both
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/DateComboBox">DateComboBox</a> and
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/ListComboBox">ListComboBox</a> extend
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/ComboBox">ComboBox</a>, which itself
    extends <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/PopupSource/">PopupSource</a>.
    This separation of concerns is vital to keep the code clean, organized, and
    maintainable. Such subclasses would likely become unworkable as Web
    Components, because each level of the class hierarchy will be competing with
    its ancestors and descendants as they all tried to extract properties from
    the single DOM content subtree permitted by the Web Components spec. If the
    choice class extracts an &lt;h3&gt; element from the content, then that
    element is effectively<em> invisible </em>to the &lt;content&gt; selectors
    of its subclasses. (Or, if you let subclasses have first shot at the
    content, then the elements they pull out are effectively invisible to their
    base classes.) This significantly complicates point #3 above (using CSS
    selectors to pull out properties from the DOM content subtree makes it hard
    to add new properties). Consider a subclass of the choice component above
    called, say, special-choice. Perhaps the author of special-choice has
    decided to use the HTML &lt;h4&gt; element to identify a particular
    property. Now the author of the base choice component decides to add a new
    property, and elects to use &lt;h4&gt; for this purpose themselves. This has
    the effect of breaking the special-choice subclass. Obviously, such naming
    conflicts can arise in regular OOP classes, but here the likelihood of
    conflict is much greater because of the highly constrained vocabulary of
    HTML elements. Using DOM structure to select properties (point #4, above) is
    even <em>more</em> brittle when one considers subclasses. If a component
    class decides to use DOM element position to select content for a given
    property, and someone creates a subclass that likewise uses element
    position, the original base class’ API is effectively frozen. Suppose the
    base class defines a &lt;content&gt; element with selector “:nth-child(3)” ,
    and the subclass goes ahead and uses a &lt;content&gt; with selector
    “:nth-child(4)”. How is the base class supposed to add support for a new
    property now? They can’t use position 4, because a subclass is already using
    that. The situation could be worked around by requiring not just specific
    tags, but also specific class names, but this has problems of its own (see
    below). As currently drafted, the Web Components spec seems highly likely to
    close off the possibility of rich component hierarchies. Most component
    developers will probably elect to just copy-and-paste useful code from other
    developers, rather than subclassing them, to preserve the ability to modify
    their components in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>
      Class names could help identify properties, but will probably just
      complicate everything.
    </h2>
    One way to skirt the problems above is to use HTML element classes to
    identify properties by class name, and reference these classes in the CSS
    selectors. If you gave up on specific HTML tags, and just used a &lt;div&gt;
    and a named element class for all properties, the second code fragment above
    could look like this:
    <pre>
&lt;x-choice value=”semantics”&gt;
  &lt;div class=”summary”&gt;Semantics&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=”description”&gt;Giving meaning to structure…&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
&lt;x-choice value=”offline-storage”&gt;
    &lt;div class=”summary”&gt;Offline &amp; Storage&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=”description”&gt;Web apps can start faster…&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
…</pre
    >
    This could potentially work if everyone agreed to <em>always</em> using an
    element class name to identify a property, and consistently applied those
    classes to a single element type (likely &lt;div&gt;) which everyone agreed
    upon would stand for “parameter”. Unfortunately, the more likely result is
    that throwing element class names into the mix will just complicate
    everything further. Some devs will write their components that way, but
    others will insist the use of HTML elements as shown above. Some will
    require the use of both specific HTML elements <em>and</em> specific class
    names. E.g., the choice component’s summary property will be forced to be
    identified with &lt;h3.summary&gt; to avoid possible conflicts with other
    &lt;h3&gt; elements in the content. This would be verbose and, worse, as a
    component user you'd have to remember and specify <em>two</em> things, when
    one should be sufficient.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>
      Invisible component APIs foreclose the possibility of inspection and
      reflection.
    </h2>
    The choice component in this example effectively presents its hosts with an
    external API that allows the host to fill in two text properties.
    Unfortunately, that API is <em>implicit</em> in the design of the
    &lt;content&gt; elements and their selectors. That makes it hard to
    programmatically understand what a component is doing. At design time,
    there’s no easy way to statically analyze the code to inspect what those
    &lt;content&gt; elements are actually being used for. You could potentially
    parse the HTML to find the &lt;content&gt; elements, then parse their CSS
    selectors, but that still wouldn't give you any hints as to what those
    &lt;content&gt; elements were being used <em>for</em>. At least a formal
    property name gives you a real idea as to its purpose. And at runtime, there
    would be no easy way to ask a choice component instance questions about
    which properties it supports: “How many properties do you have?”, or “Do you
    have a ‘description’ property?” Such run-time inspection of a component’s
    API (also known as reflection) can be a powerful tool. In this very
    presentation, Google’s developers point toward the benefits of programmatic
    inspection when they observe that giving web developers the ability to
    create new custom elements (via the &lt;element&gt; tag) will open new
    possibilities in researching possible improvements to HTML itself. For
    example, researchers could statically inspect Web Components actually used
    by production web sites to determine, for example, the names of the most
    common custom elements. That in turn could help guide the formal adoption of
    new HTML elements in future versions of the language itself. That’s just one
    example of what’s possible when APIs are explicit. Such explicitness should
    be extended beyond component names to cover component property names as
    well.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>
  A proposal to fix this: Support multiple, named, DOM-valued component
  properties
</h2>
<p>
  All the issues above could be eliminated or dramatically improved if the Web
  Components spec were amended to let developers create components that accept
  multiple, named, DOM-valued properties. (Presumably, this support would
  actually be added to HTML Templates, used by both &lt;element&gt; and
  &lt;decorator&gt; elements.)
</p>
<p>Here are some possible syntax suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>Proposal A: Use a consistent tag for component properties.</h2>
    A convention of using &lt;div&gt; elements to hold properties (see point #6
    above) is a bit odd, because the &lt;div&gt; tag is used simply as a
    placeholder. The convention could be improved by formalizing a new element
    specifically for this purpose. Perhaps the existing &lt;param&gt; tag,
    currently limited to use within &lt;object&gt; elements, could be given new
    life by being repurposed for use within components. Its definition would
    need to be extended to support a closing &lt;/param&gt; tag form that could
    encapsulate a DOM subtree:
    <pre>
&lt;x-choice value=”semantics”&gt;
    &lt;param name=”summary”&gt;Semantics&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name=”description”&gt;Giving meaning to …&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
&lt;x-choice value=”offline-storage”&gt;
    &lt;param name=”summary”&gt;Offline &amp; Storage&lt;/param&gt;
    &lt;param name=”description”&gt;Web apps can start …&lt;/param&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
…</pre
    >
    If &lt;param&gt; can’t be redefined this way, then a new tag like
    &lt;property&gt; could be created. If HTML semantics zealots insist on
    mapping component content to HTML elements, it’d be possible to let define a
    component author identify a <em>backing</em> HTML semantic tag that should
    be used to treat the property’s content for search and other purposes. E.g.,
    syntax within the &lt;element&gt; definition would indicate that the
    “summary” property should be backed by an &lt;h3&gt; element. This is
    exactly the way that the &lt;element&gt; tag’s “extends” attribute is
    already spec’ed to work. The author indicates that an &lt;x-choice&gt;
    element is backed by a &lt;div&gt;. In the exact same way, the author could
    indicate that a &lt;param&gt; (or &lt;property&gt;) of name=”summary” should
    be backed by an &lt;h3&gt;. As noted above, the particular choice of backing
    HTML element might be inconsistent or meaningless, but at least use of a
    backing element confines the problem to a much smaller audience. That is,
    the component <em>users</em> shouldn’t need to know that summary property
    behaves like an &lt;h3&gt;, just like they don’t have to know that an
    &lt;x-choice&gt; behaves like a &lt;div&gt;. Rather, that would be something
    only the component author would need to concern themselves with.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Proposal B: Expand data- attributes to support data- elements</h2>
    HTML developers can already attach arbitrary string data to HTML elements as
    data- attributes (that is, element attributes prefixed with “data-”). Web
    Components could build on this precedent to allow data-
    <em>elements</em> that specify DOM subtrees nested within the component's
    content. For example:
    <pre>
&lt;x-choice value=”semantics”&gt;

    In the case where the property values are pure text, a &lt;data-foo&gt;
    element could be interchangeable with the corresponding data-foo attribute
    within the component tag. So one could also write:
    <pre>
&lt;x-choice value=”semantics” data-summary=”Semantics”&gt;
    &lt;data-description&gt;Giving meaning to …&lt;/data-description&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;
&lt;x-choice value=”offline-storage” data-summary=”Offline &amp; Storage”&gt;
    &lt;data-description&gt;Web apps can start …&lt;/data-description&gt;
&lt;/x-choice&gt;

    The data- element form would only need to be used when specifying a real DOM
    subtree with subelements; otherwise, the data- attribute form could be used.

      Proposal C (preferred): Let developers define custom property elements
    </h2>
    The above approach could be tightened further by dropping HTML’s historic
    obsession with restricting the set of tags. By dropping by the “x-“ in the
    custom element tag, and the “data-“ in the custom property tag, we end up
    with something much cleaner:
    <pre>
&lt;choice value=”semantics”&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;Semantics&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Giving meaning to structure, …&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/choice&gt;
&lt;choice value=”offline-storage”&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;Offline &amp; Storage&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Web apps can start faster …&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/choice&gt;

    As with the data- element approach above, this custom property element
    approach could also support the use of a data- attribute on the element tag
    itself when specifying a simple string property value. The cleanliness of
    the code above comes at the cost of an ambiguity: if you can define your own
    element tags and property tags, how does the parser know which is which? In
    the code above, is &lt;summary&gt; a property of &lt;choice&gt;, or is it a
    custom element in its own right? One resolution would be a precedence rule,
    e.g., if &lt;summary&gt; is a child of a parent that has a summary property,
    then treat it as a property, otherwise instantiate it as a custom element.
    Another resolution would be to follow what Microsoft did with XAML's <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms788723.aspx#property_element_syntax"
      >property element syntax</a
    >: allow (or require) the property to be written as &lt;choice-summary&gt;.
    As noted above, if HTML powers that be insist on mapping component content
    to a fixed set of HTML elements, that could  be handled by letting a
    component author indicate the HTML element which should be used to back each
    property. Again, that would relegate the problem to something that only the
    component author would have to worry about. The writer of the code above
    that hosts the choice component wouldn’t have to obsess over the question of
    why &lt;aside&gt; was picked instead of &lt;label&gt;; that detail would
    only be visible by reading the code for the choice component. The host
    author only has to deal with &lt;summary&gt;, which has local meaning. In
    any event, the above code sample is clean, and should serve as a goal. Such
    code would be a joy to write — and read. It moves HTML definitively towards
    the creation of domain-specific languages, which is where it should go. It’s
    somewhat absurd that we can only define markup terms according to global
    consensus. That’s like waiting for a programming language committee to
    approve the names of your classes. The web will move forward at a
    <em>much</em> faster pace if we can let individual problem domains (online
    stores, news sites, social networks, games, etc.) define their own tags,
    with semantics they care about and can agree upon. As the aforementioned
    uses of &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;label&gt; illustrate, forcing developers to
    use HTML elements may give the appearance of consistent semantics, but that
    consistency is merely a facade. In contrast, letting polling organizations
    define the meaning of a &lt;summary&gt; property for a &lt;choice&gt;
    component could produce meaningful consistency within that industry.

  In their presentation, Alex and Dimitri indicated that their goal is not to
  spec out a complete replacement for web UI frameworks. Rather, the goal of
  their work is to lay a solid foundation on top of which great web UI
  frameworks can be built by others. In this light, it is hoped that the Web
  Components spec can be amended to support multiple, named, DOM-valued
  properties — because that’s exactly the foundation a great web UI framework is
  going to need.
</p>
<p>
  The QuickUI framework, at least, is more expressive with regard to component
  content than is possible within the current Web Components spec. That is to
  say, the existing Catalog of QuickUI controls (and the many others controls
  written in the service of specific QuickUI-based applications) could not be
  ported to the current Web Components spec. Or, perhaps, those controls
  <em>could</em> be ported — but then, for the reasons given above, the
  collection would then become so brittle that its evolution would come to a
  halt. That would be a shame.

  To be sure, the Google team, and the others working on Web Components, are
  smart folks, and it’s likely they’ve already given at least some thought to
  the problems raised in this post. But more input, particularly when informed
  by real application experience by potential users of a standard, is always
  valuable in weighing decisions about what should go into the standard. And
  it's in that spirit that this post is written.
</p>
<p>
  If you yourself have worked with component frameworks, and have experiences
  that bear on this issue, please share them with the folks at Google. A good
  forum for feedback might be the
