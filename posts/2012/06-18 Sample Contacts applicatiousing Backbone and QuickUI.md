  Back in April, someone evaluating QuickUI made the completely reasonable
  request to see a complete sample application created in QuickUI. More
  specifically, they were interested in seeing a demonstration of how to use
  QuickUI as the View in an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application, ideally
  using the popular
  <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> library. QuickUI is well
  suited to fill that role, and a sample application has now been created to
  show off how to do exactly that.

  The result is a
  <a href="https://quickui.org/docs/contacts.html"
    >sample Contacts application</a
  >
  built in QuickUI. The sample takes advantage of QuickUI’s support for
  CoffeeScript, which turns out to be an elegant language to express both
  Backbone and QuickUI classes. Read the sample’s documentation for more details
  of its construction.
