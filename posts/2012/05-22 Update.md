  For the past two months or so, I’ve left off from my weekly blogging habit
  here to focus on some behind-the-scenes aspect of QuickUI. I post about those
  updates on the separate QuickUI blog. That blog is more technically-oriented,
  but I though it was worth sharing a roundup of those posts here:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I’ve made a number of improvements to the QuickUI runtime, including a
    <a
      href="http://blog.quickui.org/2012/05/15/quickui-0-9-a-significant-update/"
      >significant version update</a
    >. One interesting new feature is support for creating UI in CoffeeScript
    (in addition to plain JavaScript).
  </li>
  <li>
    A developer asked for sample application code showing how to use QuickUI as
    the “View” in an application with an MVC (Model-View-Controller)
    architecture. That’s a great idea, and to date I haven’t had such a sample I
    could offer. Cozi’s
    <a href="http://www.cozi.com/Meal-Planner.htm">Meal Planner</a> is actually
    a Model-View-Presenter that uses QuickUI for the View, but the source for
    that application is proprietary. It’ll be useful to have an interesting
    MVC/MVP sample application that shows off how to use QuickUI; I’ll post back
    here when I have something worth looking at. Thanks for the suggestion,
    Chris!

    I continue to be interested in making sure the emerging Web Components spec
    is well-suited to the scenarios routinely faced by UI designers and
    developers, and have articulated a vision for
    <a
      href="http://blog.quickui.org/2012/04/16/a-vision-for-coevolving-quickui-and-the-emerging-web-components-standard/"
      >how QuickUI and Web Components could co-evolve</a
    >. This has included some time
    <a
      href="http://blog.quickui.org/2012/04/27/how-quickui-controls-use-code-to-specialize-the-handling-of-their-content-in-ways-that-might-not-be-supported-by-web-components/"
      >analyzing the QuickUI Catalog controls</a
    >
    in light of the Web Components spec. On that note, I’m looking forward to a
    meeting with the spec’s author, Dimitri Glazkov, later this week.
  </li>
  <li>
    A designer friend suggested creating a new QuickUI screencast. The few
    QuickUI screencasts I’ve done in the past are now out-of-date, and my ideas
    about how to explain the value of component-based UI development have
    evolved, so it’s a good time for a new one.
  </li>
  <li>
    Along those lines, I’ve invested some time improving the framework
    documentation, including an
    <a href="https://quickui.org/docs/rendering.html"
      >overview of how QuickUI controls render themselves</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    I also continue to improve the
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</a> controls, although
    at a slower pace. The above work on the fundamentals and explaining them is
    taking precedence for the time being.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thanks to those who have shared suggestions with me — they’re very helpful. If
  you take a look at any of the above and have feedback, please let me know.
