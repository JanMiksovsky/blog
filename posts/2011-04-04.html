  I love the spirit of this oft-heard design maxim, but it’s not a
  <em>recipe</em> for design, or at least not for iterative software user
  experience design. The statement suggests you could design something that’s
  more elaborate than what would be ideal, then chisel away at it until you’re
  done. That approach might work for a one-off product, but in an evolving
  software app, removing something is rarely an option. All apps have to evolve
  or die, and since a product’s feature set nearly always increases in
  complexity over time, virtually all UI evolution is additive. Indeed, it’s so
  rare that a designer gets the chance to actually remove something in version
  <em>n</em>+1 that it’s notable

    >when it happens</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The only time you, as a designer, generally have the freedom to remove
  anything is before it gets into a user’s hands. After that, it’s almost a
  foregone conclusion that the feature will stay around for the life of the
  product. The only way to “remove” something is often to start over with a
  completely new product, typically on a new platform. The corollary of
  Exupéry’s claim in the UX realm might be that each product iteration should
  add as little as possible. You never know in which ways your evolving feature
  set will impose new design considerations, and what was perfect in version
  <em>n</em> might no longer be desired in version <em>n</em>+1.

  With that in mind, when Cozi first designed a month view for our web client in
  late 2007, we felt that it was our last best chance to strip all the junk that
  normally clutters up month views (here, Microsoft Outlook 2010):

  Aside from the obvious clutter, it’s worth pointing out that this view
  <em
    >doesn’t even show the majority of the appointments actually in this user’s
    calendar</em
  >. At this size, the user only sees the first few appointments each day (which
  may or may not be the most important). To see the rest, the user must click
  the disclosure triangles in the lower-right corner of each day—which take the
  user completely out of context to another view entirely. And, in my opinion,
  the category-based color coding that’s quite useful in day view unfortunately
  overwhelms the user’s attention in month view.

  Since we were effectively starting over on a new platform (as noted above, the
  most likely opportunity to remove something), we <em>did</em> have the chance
  to remove stuff. Asking ourselves, “What would Tufte do?”, we produced a
  minimalistic initial design concept:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

      style="
        background-image: none;
        padding-left: 0px;
        padding-right: 0px;
        display: inline;
        padding-top: 0px;
        border-width: 0px;
      "

      width="603"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  The main points were to remove the boxes around everything, eliminate
  background color for all but the most notable events, and to tone the
  gridlines way back. We also decided that a calendar view was almost useless if
  it hid appointments, and decided that the grid rows would vary in height to
  contain all the data. Since many people use months to conceptually map out
  their near future, we wanted to clearly delineate the month transitions with
  both boundary lines and a color change. We made the dates much larger (like
  those on many wall calendars) and pushed them into a background layer so that
  they could be easier to spot without consuming more room. And we maintained
  the Cozi precedent for showing non-routine appointments in bold so that they
  would be easier to spot.
</p>
<p>
  By the time we shipped, we’d actually gone even further, removing all
  gridlines entirely. This is our initial web implementation:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

        padding-right: 0px;
        display: inline;
        padding-top: 0px;
        border-width: 0px;
      "

      width="640"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  Users told us we’d gone too far, and that it was hard to figure out which
  appointments went on which dates. In a later version, we added the horizontal
  rules line in:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>

      border="0"

      style="

        padding-left: 0px;
        padding-right: 0px;
        display: inline;
        padding-top: 0px;
        border-width: 0px;
      "
      title="Cozi Calendar Month View (horiziontal rules)"
      width="640"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  This design has generally performed well, although we receive a range of
  feedback. For example, there’s a certain type of user who really,
  <em>really</em> wants vertical gridlines, not just horizontal gridlines. We
  prefer to use negative space itself as a sort of virtual gridline. We clip
  long appointment text on the right end of a day cell, which creates a vertical
  line of negative space. This effectively separates one day from the next
  without the cost of additional clutter.
</p>
<p>
  One issue not revealed in these images is that we hadn’t gotten around to
  coding the thicker boundaries between months as called for in the original
  design. We recently got around to fixing that, and now use both a thick line
  and a background color change to delineate months:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

        padding-top: 0px;
        border-width: 0px;
      "
      title="Cozi Calendar Month View (month boundaries)"
      width="640"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  We’ve also made other changes made along the way, like a switch to a
  <a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2010/08/lessons-switching-our-web-ui-from-stock-fonts-to-a-proprietary-font.html"
    >custom font</a
  >, and dynamically vary leading to pack in more appointments into the same
  vertical space. We still haven’t implemented highlighting for special dates
  like birthdays or holidays, although perhaps we’ll get to that at some point.
</p>
<p>
  We’re generally pretty cautious about adding something new.We’re cognizant of
  the possibility that the design might not work out for everyone—but the users
  who <em>did</em> like it would be unhappy if we tried to take the feature
  away. As said before, app UIs generally accrete new elements. This makes it
  challenging to deliver a clean design—and keep it clean.
