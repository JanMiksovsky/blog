<p>
  This post marks my 100th post on flow|state. My
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2005/07/cant_sleep.html"
    >first post</a
  >&#0160;was on July 11, 2005, so by pure coincidence this milestone comes
  exactly on the blog’s birthday. There was a 1½ year blogging hiatus in 2009-10
  (because 1 startup + 3 little kids = 0 discretionary time), so I’ve done about
  4½ years of actual blogging. This works out to a post roughly every two weeks.
</p>
<p>
  I’m still passionate about learning and teaching the craft of user interface
  design. When I started this blog, I thought I would focus exclusively on
  client-side app UI, but I shifted my attention to the web when my company,
  Cozi, did so in 2008; later my interests extended to mobile UI as well.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve tried to focus on my own direct personal experiences as a UX designer,
  with an eye towards sharing practical knowledge to people in the industry, or
  conveying a sense of the designer’s work to a general audience. I generally
  prefer to write about the products I know best: the ones I’ve worked on. In
  cases where I critique other products to make a point, I try to concentrate on
  the nitty-gritty details of a UI that may go overlooked by users, but which
  nevertheless affect the user experience.
</p>
<p>
  This focus is borne out in this list of the most popular posts on flow|state,
  either having driven the biggest transient spikes in traffic or for driving
  the most visits over time.

  One thing I’ve missed over the past year is more engagement with you, the
  readers. A while back I tried to ward off comment trolls and spam by turning
  on the requirement that commenters must be signed in. This kept away trolls
  and spam—and everyone else. On the suggestion of a friend, I’m giving unsigned
  <em>moderated </em>comments a try to see that encourages more discussion.
</p>
<p>
  In that spirit, I’d love to hear from you about this blog, especially the
  sorts of posts you’ve found most helpful or interesting. Leave a comment or
  send email via the About page.

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
