<p>
  It's been way too long since I was last able to post here, mostly because
  having three small children equates to having zero personal time. Still, work
  has been productive. Today Cozi posted an update to the web version of our
  <a href="http://www.cozi.com/products/familycalendar.aspx">family calendar</a
  >. Our web calendar has long lagged behind the PC version, but we've been
  working hard to correct that, and today's release represents a big step
  towards that goal.
</p>
<p>Before today, the calendar was a bare-bones UI that looked like this:</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/WindowsLiveWriter/Calendar%20-%20Old.png"
    ><img
      width="640"
      height="462"
      border="0"
      src="/images/flowstate/Calendar%20-%20Old_thumb.png"
      alt="Calendar - Old"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>The new calendar looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/WindowsLiveWriter/Calendar%20-%20New.png"
    ><img
      width="640"
      height="462"
      border="0"
      src="/images/flowstate/Calendar%20-%20New_thumb.png"
      alt="Calendar - New"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>
  We still have a long list of improvements in the works for the calendar, but
  this latest public release already includes a range of large feature
  enhancements and small fit-and-finish details that collectively make the new
  calendar, IMHO, quite polished for an AJAX UI:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Asynchronous loading of appointment data. We used to reload the entire page
    whenever we needed to display new calendar data (e.g., when adding an
    appointment). Now we just refresh the days we need to.&nbsp;
  </li>

  <li>
    Infinite scrolling. The old implementation would only let you see one week's
    worth of appointments at a time. Movement between weeks was generally
    managed with &quot;Previous Week&quot; and &quot;Next Week&quot; links. The
    new UI uses infinite scrolling, so the user can move as far into the future
    (or past) as they need to with just the scroll bar. This work dovetails with
    the aforementioned async loading of data.
  </li>

  <li>
    Complete typography overhaul. Improved margins and leading make it easier to
    visually parse the information into three vertical columns and a large
    horizontal row for each date. This included details like right-aligning the
    color-coded family member dots so that they are visually grouped with the
    appointment subject.
  </li>

  <li>
    We took extreme pains to line up the start times and end times by the colons
    to improve legibility. This was somewhat at odds with our desire to follow
    proper typographic convention and separate times with an
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endash#En_dash">endash</a> instead of
    a hyphen. Using an endash with vertically-aligned colons produced a
    situation in which a bit of extra white space would appear before end time
    that had a single hours digit. That is, &quot;–<span face="Courier New"
      >&nbsp; 3:00</span
    >&quot; would have more interior space than
    <span face="Courier New">&quot;</span>–<span face="Courier New"> 12:00</span
    >&quot;. We finessed this by using an endash when the end time has a single
    digit hour, but a hyphen when the end time has a double digit hour:<br /><br /><img
      width="135"
      height="112"
      border="0"
      src="/images/flowstate/Cozi%20Calendar%20Timetable.png"
      alt="Cozi Calendar Timetable"
    />
    <br /><br />For all we know zillions of other people have done the same
    thing, but we think this bending of the rules lets you produce a clean and
    highly legible timetable with plain HTML.<br />
  </li>

  <li>
    Tuned the color of all text elements in the calendar data. Dates are shown
    in color, body text in gray. For contrast, the subjects of a non-routine
    appointment (something that doesn't happen weekly) are set in black to make
    them stand out—since those are the appointments a family needs to focus
    their attention on.
  </li>

  <li>
    Placed the day of the week over the date. Users of a family calendar are
    extremely interested in what's happening during the coming week, and much
    less so in what's happening months away. Placing the day of the week over
    the date reflects that priority.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tweaked the background color banding on alternate days to make it a bit more
    prominent. This is really hard to get right so that it's perceptible on all
    monitors, but not overpowering on monitors with excessive contrast.
  </li>

  <li>
    Revised the UI controls for selecting the family member whose calendar you
    want to look at. The old design had big tabs, which users immediately
    understand, but they occupied more space than was justified by their
    relatively infrequent use. We took the opportunity to more explicitly
    present the list of names as a legend for the color-coded dots.
  </li>

  <li>
    Added gradients to the colored bars at the top and bottom of the calendar.
    These are done as a series of one pixel-high DIVs so that we can easily swap
    out the gradient based on the current family member's color without needing
    to store a ton of images.
  </li>

  <li>Cleaned up element margins overall.</li>

  <li>
    Tightened borders around the natural language appointment entry area at the
    bottom.
  </li>

  <li>
    Shifted the little triangle that had been to the left of the text box so
    that now it's inside the box. That triangle is one of a pair of triangles
    used to visually imply a connection between the text box and the calendar:
    the triangle on the calendar indicates the day where new typed appointments
    will go (if you don't type a date). Moving the bottom triangle inside the
    box more clearly connects the two triangles: they're now directly
    horizontally lined up, and they can now both share the same black color.
    (Users will readily infer a connection between two elements on a page if
    they share a color.)
  </li>

  <li>
    Shortened the hint text inside the text box. Although being able to
    double-click a day to create an appointment is a useful shortcut, users can
    find it on their own without instruction.
  </li>

  <li>
    In that same area, replaced the &quot;What can I type?&quot; link (which was
    spec'ed as white, but had ended up as black due to a bug) with a smaller
    question mark icon.
  </li>

  <li>
    Cleaned up the &quot;Home&quot; button script in the upper left. We'd
    previously used <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr">sIFR</a> for
    this and other instances of &quot;handwritten&quot; text in the product.
    It's a nice bit of technology, but in this case the text was static, so
    using Flash was complete overkill. Now it's a simple transparent PNG (or a
    <a href="http://blogs.cozi.com/tech/2008/03/transparent-png.html"
      >transparent PNG8 in IE 6.x</a
    >).
  </li>

  <li>
    Cleaned up the mini-calendar on left. The mini-calendar now shows a minimal
    set of information and controls in its normal state (when the mouse isn't
    over it). This keeps the UI clean. When the user moves the mouse over the
    mini-calendar, various navigation controls appear for navigation to the
    previous month, the next month, and today. In the rollover state, the
    mini-calendar also shows the dates at the end of the previous month and the
    dates at the beginning of the next month. This makes it quicker to navigate
    to dates just outside the current month. We've built this calendar by
    styling the
    <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker">jQuery UI date picker</a>,
    which has worked well in practice.
  </li>

  <li>
    Added advertising in the left pane. Hey, we have to pay for all this work
    somehow! We've been careful to keep advertising separate from the family's
    calendar content on the right.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, we're quite happy with the result. We have more improvements to the
  Cozi calendar in the works, and are eager for those to see the light of day
  too.
