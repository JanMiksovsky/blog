  As animations make their way into more user interfaces, many applications
  would benefit from a simple trick: speeding up routine animations after the
  user has had a chance to digest the animation’s message.
</p>
<p>
  An interesting and fairly thorough
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511285.aspx"
    >Animations Overview</a
  >
  from MSDN describes several different reasons for using animation in a user
  interface “to give feedback, preview the effect of an action, show the
  relationship between objects, draw attention to change, or explain a task
  visually.” More and more applications are using animations for these purposes
  as web UI frameworks like jQuery and mobile platforms have made implementing
  such animations trivial.
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally one can come across an animation that’s elegant and informative
  the first time one sees it, but which eventually gets tiresome. I’ll use the
  otherwise excellent Windows Phone 7 home screen as a case in point. I’ve been
  trying a Samsung Focus phone with the Windows Phone 7 OS for the past couple
  of weeks, and in general I think it’s 80% awesome. (I wish the Facebook app
  were faster; it needs a Google Reader app as good as Reeder; it needs backup
  and restore; and the phone’s browser is an abomination.) In its favor, the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_UI">Metro User Interface Style</a>
  is elegant to a revolutionary degree. Windows Phone 7’s clean UI makes Apple’s
  iOS look kitschy and cluttered.
</p>

  The Windows Phone 7 home screen plays a quick animation when you tap on an app
  tile (the squares above). The tiles on the page all flip away, but the tile
  you tapped on lingers just a fraction of a second longer to confirm what app
  you’re about to see. This is all quite elegant and subtly informative. It also
  gets old fast.
</p>
<p>
  If you launch, say, the email client, it will play its own beautiful
  animation. When you navigate back to the home screen, you see both animations
  again in reverse. To slip between two email accounts via the home screen, you
  see four separate animations: email closing, home page resuming, home page
  launching app, email app opening. These short animations add up, and start to
  grate. You already understand their point, and each additional playing of the
  animations just beats that point into the ground.
</p>
<p>
  A quick cure for a situation like this is to speed up the animation. You can
  play a fairly long one second animation the first time, play it for only half
  a second the next time, then a quarter second, and thereafter either leave a
  residual high-speed animation or drop it altogether.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s a simple example. Cozi’s family calendar has a toolbar at the top with
  a text entry area in which the user can type new appointments in natural
  language. This text entry area is normally shown in a collapsed state to save
  space:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e20148c7ecc442970c-pi"
    ><img
      src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e20148c7ecc459970c-pi.png"
      alt="Cozi Calendar Toolbar Animation 1"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>
  When the user starts typing, or explicitly clicks in the text entry area, the
  area transitions to an expanded state:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e20148c7ecc473970c-pi"
    ><img
      src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e20148c7ecc492970c-pi.png"
      alt="Cozi Calendar Toolbar Animation 2"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>This transition has four components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The text area gains a box around it. This lets the user know they can type.
  </li>
  <li>
    The text area grows wider. This gives the user more room to type long
    appointments. The area animates from its original narrow width to the full
    width of the main page area. This animation lets the user know that the
    narrow text area and the wide text box are, in fact, the same thing. The
    user can infer that this wide box has the same intent (“Type appointment”)
    as the original narrow area.
  </li>
  <li>
    A white layer over the rest of the toolbar controls animates from fully
    transparent to semi-opaque. This helps make the wider text area stand out,
    and suggests a quasi-modal state. Again, the animation orients the user;
    they understand that the faded controls are the same ones they were looking
    at a second ago, only now those controls are not relevant.
  </li>
  <li>
    Additional controls appear(“X” for cancel, “What can I type”?) which are
    specific to this modal state.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The animation of the text box’s width (#2) and the background opacity (#3) run
  concurrently for a short duration. We wanted the animation to be visible to
  new users so they could visually parse what was happening. However, it turns
  out that text entry is not possible until the animation completes, so a long
  animation will not only get tedious, it will slow the user down. (And even if
  the user could type while the animation was running, most people would
  probably wait for the animation to finish before starting to type.)
</p>
<p>
  So the compromise is this: the first time the user triggers the animation, it
  runs for 600 milliseconds (i.e., 6/10 of a second). Thereafter, the animation
  runs for only 200 milliseconds (three times as fast). This simple speeding-up
  seems to work well in practice. Users appear to successfully understand the
  animation’s message, and at the same time we’ve never heard complaints that
  the animation is slow or gets in the way.
</p>
<p>
  Going back to Windows Phone 7, that team seems have lavished so much attention
  on their UI,&#0160;let’s give them the benefit of the doubt, and assume that
  they not only thought about speeding up their routine animations, but had a
  good reason&#0160;<em>not</em>&#0160;to&#0160;do that here. Perhaps switching
  an app takes a couple of seconds no matter what, and the animations at least
  give you something to watch while that’s happening in the background. In which
  case, this solution might not have helpful in this particular case.
</p>
<p>
  In general, though, this is such a simple trick that it’s worth adding to your
  bag of tricks in anticipation of the next time you&#0160;want to add an
  animation users will see all the time.
