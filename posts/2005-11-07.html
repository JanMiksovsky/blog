  I recently came across an elegant demonstration for getting the user to
  specify a preference by offering examples to choose from. This technique is
  often done with visual settings (e.g., letting a user select a template for a
  document by clicking on sample template thumbnails), but in this case, the
  technique was applied in letting a user specify a simple textual setting for a
  date format.
</p>

  I've been looking at some web sites that help manage To Do lists, including
  <a href="http://tadalists.com">tadalists.com</a>,
  <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">rememberthemilk.com</a>, and
  <a href="http://mypimp.com">mypimp.com</a>. (Where do they get these names?
  The latter could adopt the slogan, &quot;We think having a borderline
  offensive name is so funny it's worth giving up market share!&quot;) All these
  sites strive to be as interactive as possible, and to some extent they each
  struggle with the absence of conventions for entering data on highly
  interactive web pages. This has produced some interesting and creative UI
  experiments, some of which succeed.
</p>
<p>
  One bit of creativity (albeit in a non-interactive area) shows up in the
  account setup page for rememberthemilk.com:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/remember_the_milk.Png"
    title="Remember_the_milk"
    alt="Remember_the_milk"
  />
</p>
<p>
  It's the last line that caught my attention. The label for the radio buttons
  doesn't even say what you're picking (preferred date format), but it's obvious
  what you're supposed to do: pick the sample that shows the date the way you
  like it. What's particularly interesting is that this trick capitalizes on a
  person's ability to recognize patterns at a subconscious level. I live in a
  country where the month comes before the date, so the first option
  (&quot;14/02/05&quot;) looks like a jumble of numbers to me, while the second
  option (&quot;02/14/05&quot;) leaps off the page as a valid date. Presumably
  people who live in date-first countries have the opposite reaction.
</p>
<p>
  It may turn out that this trick only works in narrowly constrained
  circumstances; perhaps it would stop working, for example, if they needed to
  support a broader range of date formats. Nevertheless, it's impressive that
  rememberthemilk is able to ask for something as mundane as a date format in a
  manner consistent with the site's overall casual visual and textual tone.
