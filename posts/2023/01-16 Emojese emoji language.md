The [Emojese emoji language](https://emojese.org) is rich enough to express complex thoughts entirely in emoji and other Unicode glyphs. I think emoji languages are a fun idea, so I thought I’d write up a little about my experience creating Emojese.

When I looked for an emoji language in 2020, I couldn’t find anything satisfying. I found inspiration in things like the [KomunIKON](https://www.komunikon.com) project and the emoji book [Book from the Ground: from point to point](http://www.xubing.com/en/work/details/188?classID=10&type=class#188), but I wanted something you could send as real text on any device.

My kids and I explored ideas which I formalized into Emojese and embodied in the above app for writing and reading sentences. Emojese is a pidgin language with a handful of grammar suggestions and emoji definitions for 1000+ words.

A friend and I had a ton of fun texting back and forth in Emojese for several months — a 🕵️Secret Decoder Ring for texting! Before long, we could read Emojese messages without the app. I expect you would experience similar results.

All emoji languages initially look overwhelming — it’s hard to read so many unfamiliar images, the choice of symbols feels arbitrary, and the constraints of existing emoji result in unfamiliar pairings like 👉☀️ for "today".

The best I can hope for is that, after seeing a translation, you feel it's reasonable and that the few unavoidable abstract symbols are memorable. If you come to learn 👉 as "this" and "☀️", then 👉☀️ for "this day"/"today" seems comprehensible.

As a harder test, here’s a quip I translated into Emojese expressing a more complex sentiment you probably haven’t heard before:

One of my kids and their high school friends had fun playing with Emojese messages on their Discord server. It took about 10 minutes for the conversation to veer into insults like `🫵の👩‍🍼`, which goes to show that the street finds its own uses for things.
