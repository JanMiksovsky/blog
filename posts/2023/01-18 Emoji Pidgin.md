title: Emoji‚Äôs destiny is to become a global written pidgin language

Emoji dramatically extend the world‚Äôs set of commonly-understood symbols. There were universal symbols before emoji, but they were generally confined to domains like math, science, and music. Emoji has increased that universal set by an order of magnitude. I assume it‚Äôs also shifting what can be understood across cultures.

As a software designer in the 1990s, I received instruction from our international localization teams to avoid using gestures like üëç in icons because some cultures interpreted them as offensive. As software has eaten the world, the cultural preferences of its makers has spread as well. I assume that _in the context of software_ most people can now recognize the intended positive meaning of üëç regardless of their cultural background.

With emoji as an expanding foundation for cross-cultural communication, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch to imagine the eventual emergence of a basic grammar and some adoption of existing symbols for specific abstract meanings. That is, emoji will form the basis of a written pidgin language: a simplified language that is incomplete but can nevertheless fill a useful role.

Isn‚Äôt that a beautiful idea worth encouraging? Any specific constructed emoji language like the [Emojese emoji language](https://emojese.org) is unlikely to take root ‚Äî but we can watch for something similar to spontaneously emerge and spread around the world.

My guess: a charismatic young YouTuber musician or music group introduces a written emoji pidgin as a way to connect with a global audience of fans, who pick up the pidgin to talk to each other across a language boundary.
