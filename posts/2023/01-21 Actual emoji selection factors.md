title: The actual selection factors for new Unicode emoji proposals

The Unicode emoji proposal process is open to the public in theory, but after doing a fair bit of work to submit what I felt was a compelling [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y-aO0tl6LnSpHavLnpESRt6h5Idz4K0_/view?usp=sharing), I never received any indication of _why_ it was rejected, nor could I find any published explanation of the acceptance or rejection of other proposals. This makes it hard for anyone to gauge whether a proposal is worth submitting, or understand what could have been done differently to lead to a successful outcome.

The subcommittee has a challenging role: Adding emojis to every device (particularly cheap ones) has a real cost, and they want to keep costs low for their vendor members. At the same time, they want to satisfy/appease the world’s screaming demand for more emojis.

The subcommittee’s publicly stated [selection factors for emoji](http://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html#selection_factors) are:

1. compatibility
2. usage level
3. distinctiveness
4. completeness

That said, the committee wasn’t willing to approve an emoji to represent “I”/“me”, possibly the noun with the highest frequency word across all languages, and one with thousands of years of history of consistent visual representation. So there must be other factors at play.

As best as I can tell by reading recent emoji approvals like the [new emojis in Unicode 15.0](https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-15-0/), the subcommittee’s actual selection factors are something like:

1. Is it a heart or a face? People like those.
2. Is it a charismatic fauna or flora, or a popular food? People like those.
3. Is it an important cultural totem? Please like those — and it’s hard to tell a group they don’t deserve representation.

If these really are the criteria applied to new proposals, the subcommittee is leading people to waste their time crafting proposals that have no chance of being accepted. If I had known these things beforehand, I would not have invested time submitting a proposal.

Beyond that, I think limiting new emoji to “things people like" seems like a cramped vision of what emoji could do for humanity. Focusing on _things people actually talk about_ seems like a better, less arbitrary metric that would enable more substantive — and fun! — communication.

The one bright spot in the emoji submission process were the wonderful people at [Emojination](https://www.emojination.org/), especially emoji maven Jennifer Lee. She was the producer for the movie [The Emoji Story](https://www.theemojistory.com/) (which is worth a watch), and leads an active and supportive Slack channel for emoji proposals. If you have any interest in submitting a proposal, I’d start there.
