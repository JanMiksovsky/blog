title: Reconsolidating blog content
date: 2023-01-01

I recently consolidated content from three earlier blogs to create a new blog at https://jan.miksovsky.com. This includes content from: a) flow|state, a UI design blog I wrote from 2005–2014, b) a blog for my UI component framework called QuickUI from 2012–2013, and c) the blog for my second startup, Component Kitchen, which was generally focused on web components from 2014–2020.

My goal has been to create a single site for my professional work. I've also been invigorated by the recent resurrection of interest in blogging which has been spurred by Twitter's self-immolation, and by my growing unease in letting corporations mediate our public presence.

I ported and consolidated this content, and am serving it at this new location, using a new set of tools I hope to begin discussing publicly soon.
