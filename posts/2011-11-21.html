  Johannes Tonollo’s excellent
  <a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com">Meaningful Transitions</a> site does a
  thorough job cataloguing animated transitions that can be used to convey
  specific messages to a user. One animation I’ve always liked was expanding an
  element on hover, as in this screen within Windows Media Center:

<p><strong>Key attributes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When the mouse hovers over a list item (or the keyboard focus moves to it),
    the item becomes highlighted.
  </li>
  <li>
    The highlighted item animates in size, expanding in every direction. It
    covers the adjacent items. The other items (the ones which are not
    highlighted) retain their position.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bringing the highlighted item forward conveys the feeling that the item is
    ready for use or instruction, like a volunteer in a line of people stepping
    forward. In this case, the highlighted movie is brought forward to indicate
    that it’s ready to be played.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the highlight moves to another item, the previously-highlighted item
    animates back to its original state in parallel with the highlight animation
    being played on the new item.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HighlightEffects</strong></p>
<p>
  I’ve posted a
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/HighlightEffects">HighlightEffects</a>
  control to the QuickUI Catalog that permits the easy creation of animated
  effects such as expand-to-highlight. Here’s a sample showing the result of
  moving the mouse over the second of five items:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

      style="

        padding-left: 0px;
        padding-right: 0px;
        display: inline;
        padding-top: 0px;
        border: 0px;
      "
      title="HighlightEffects"
      width="255"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p>
  Use HighlightEffects with lists to help the user see which element is
  highlighted, and to suggest that the highlighted item is ready for use. You
  can apply a variety of highlight effects to achieve different results. The one
  shown here – expand to highlight – effectively draws the user’s attention to
  the item without being too distracting.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>
<p>
  I thought it would be elegant to let the UI designer/developer define the
  package of highlight effects as CSS in a JavaScript property map, just as in
  jQuery’s <a href="http://api.jquery.com/animate/">$.animate()</a> function.
  The HighlightEffects control uses this property map to determine which CSS
  rules will need to be <em>un</em>-done when the highlight moves away from an
  item. E.g., if the property map includes background-color, then the element’s
  original background-color is saved; when the highlight is removed, this
  original background-color is restored.
</p>
<p>
  The main challenge with the expand-to-highlight effect is keeping the layout
  of the page steady as the highlight moves around. To get the highlighted
  element to pop out, we need to change its size and z-index, and apply absolute
  positioning. Without that, the expanded item would push the other items in the
  list to the sides. However, the use of position: absolute will remove the item
  from the layout flow. To keep things from moving around, we can empty the same
  technique
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2011/11/persistentpanel.html"
    >discussed last week</a
  >
  for <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/PersistentPanel">PersistentPanel</a>:
  wrap each list item in a placeholder of the item’s normal size. This
  placeholder remains in the layout flow even when the item is highlighted, so
  nothing behind the highlighted element will move around.
</p>
<p>
  In playing around with various animation effects, it was clear that some
  arrangements animate more smoothly than others. For example, I originally
  tried to keep the text of the elements centered, but the repositioning of the
  text during resize was a bit jittery. Animations which change size, position,
  and color all seem to behave fairly smoothly on the devices and browsers I’ve
  got. It turns out that jQuery’s built-in $.animate() function doesn’t support
  color animations out of the box, but that ability can be supplied with a
  plugin like
  <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color-animation">Color Animation</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  As was the case when writing the
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2011/10/listcombobox.html"
    >post on ListComboBox</a
  >, I left out keyboard support, so this currently only works with a mouse (and
  touch, although the effect isn’t as nice). My plan is to follow up with a
  ListBox control that can handle moving a selection with a keyboard, then
  update HighlightEffects to work with that.
