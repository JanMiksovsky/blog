  Sites adopting AJAX and other interactive techniques are increasingly giving
  users the ability to express preferences or change settings <em>in situ</em>,
  without having to navigate to a separate page just to change the way things
  work. This direction seems promising, but until standards emerge it's also
  fraught with the potential to confuse users or simply get in the way.
</p>
<p>
  The wiki vendor JotSpot, for example, allows a user to rename a page by
  hovering over the page title:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    alt="Jotspot_page_title"
    title="Jotspot_page_title"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/jotspot_page_title.png"
  />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img
    border="0"
    alt="Jotspot_page_title_hover"
    title="Jotspot_page_title_hover"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/jotspot_page_title_hover.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  An earlier generation of web sites required the user to travel to another page
  to make such an edit in the text box of a web form, then submit their changes.
  Here the interactivity is lightweight and allows for quicker changes.
</p>
<p>
  In a similar vein, various web portals let the user personalize the look and
  content of their home page by directly interacting with page content. The
  <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">customziable Google home page</a> puts
  links in the corner of each blurb to customize the blurb's size or remove the
  blurb entirely:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    alt="Google_home_page_blurb"
    title="Google_home_page_blurb"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/google_home_page_blurb.Png"
  />
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  To my recollection, MSN was one of the first portals (if not the first) to
  offer lightweight editing on its own
  <a href="http://my.msn.com">customizable home page</a>. This interactivity is
  still there today, albeit with some heavy visuals and advertising:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/msn_home_page_customization.Png"
    ><img
      border="0"
      src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/msn_home_page_customization.Png"
      title="Msn_home_page_customization"
      alt="Msn_home_page_customization"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>
  The main issue with all such lightweight editing facilities is the possibility
  of interfering with the average user's use of the product. If the user is just
  trying to read something, the editing controls can be distracting. At worse,
  they can throw the user into a mode that they didn't want to be inâ€”or into a
  mode they're not even aware they're in. The situation will improve as more
  conventions emerge for lightweight editing of page content, but until then
  it's worth incorporating such interactivity cautiously.
