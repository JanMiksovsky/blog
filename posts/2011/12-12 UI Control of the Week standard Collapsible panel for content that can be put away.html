<p>
  It&#39;s fairly common for a UI to present some content whose value to the
  user may be unknown or may change over time. To avoid permanently distracting
  the user, the app can show the content in a panel the user can collapse.
  Consider the following two gadgets from Google’s Gmail client, the first
  expanded, the second collapsed:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

    alt="Gmail Gadgets"
  />
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the user leaves the calendar gadget open because they find the
  considerable clutter it adds is worth its informational value. The “Invite a
  friend” gadget, however, isn’t worth much to them, so they collapse it and
  leave it that way. In the rare event they&#39;re suddenly inspired to invite a
  friend, it&#39;s easy enough to re-expand that panel to bring the UI back.
</p>
<p><strong>Key attributes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Clicking anywhere in the heading collapses the panel&#39;s content, leaving
    only the heading visible.
  </li>
  <li>
    The heading generally reacts to mouse-over by changing the cursor to a hand.
    The heading may also react in other ways, e.g., its background color may
    change.
  </li>
  <li>
    In many cases, including the above example, the heading includes a small
    button element on the far right. Clicking this button has the same effect as
    clicking the heading itself, but the button offers a more obvious affordance
    of interactivity.
  </li>
  <li>
    If present, the button&#39;s icon or contents generally reflect the
    panel&#39;s collapsed or expanded state. The button may show plus and minus
    signs or down- and up-pointing arrows. The icon usually suggests what will
    happen if you click it (e.g., if you click the plus, you’ll get
    <em>more </em>UI), rather than indicating the current state.
  </li>
  <li>
    The transition between the expanded and collapsed state is usually animated
    to suggest that the content is rolling up into the heading, where it will be
    stored until the user decides to retrieve it again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many applications save the collapsed/expanded state for future sessions. In
    effect, the collapsible panel is offering a persistent user-configurable
    option, without any of the overhead of a separate Settings or Preferences
    area.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collapsible and CollapsibleWithHeadingButton</strong></p>
<p>
  I&#39;ve posted a
  <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/Collapsible">Collapsible</a> control to
  the QuickUI Catalog that offers the bare-bones functionality. Because the
  pattern of including a little button on the heading’s right is so common, I
  also added a subclass called
  <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/CollapsibleWithHeadingButton"
    >CollapsibleWithHeadingButton</a
  >:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

    alt="CollapsibleWithHeadingButton"
  />
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  Use these Collapsible classes to confer a limited degree of customizability to
  a home page or information pane on the side. If most users are likely to want
  the information most of the time, collapsible panels might not be necessary.
  However, in cases where there&#39;s a fairly even split between users that
  want a given type of information and those that don&#39;t, such a panel can be
  a reasonable compromise. Similarly, if there are situations where an
  individual user may change their mind about whether they want the information
  (because it&#39;s useful) or not want the information (because it&#39;s
  distracting), consider a collapsible panel.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>
<p>
  To avoid requiring lots of graphic resources, for many of these controls I use
  text glyphs as button icons. Here a plus sign (“+”) is used in the collapsed
  state to indicate the content can be expanded, and a minus sign (“−”) is used
  when the content can be collapsed. I&#39;ve seen some sites that, perhaps
  unintentionally, use a hyphen (“-”) instead of a minus sign. A hyphen is too
  narrow, and ends up feeling like a weak counterpart to the plus sign. (Google
  avoids this by using a bitmap image, probably for tighter control over the
  final result across different browsers.)
</p>
<p>
  One thing that feels a bit unresolved about gadgets like Gmail&#39;s, which
  offer a heading button on the right, is that the button and the heading text
  both do the same thing, but that shared behavior&#0160;is not obvious until
  you click.&#0160;My general feeling is that multiple controls that respond the
  same way to a click should respond the same way on hover. In this case, I
  arranged for mousing over the heading text to force the application of the
  button’s hover effect, even if the mouse isn’t actually over the button, as an
  extra cue that clicking either UI element will accomplish the same result. See

    >Where should the hit target boundaries for UI elements go?</a
  >
  for more thoughts on reflecting hit target boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  The animation effect includes a combination of a slide and a fade: the
  contents fade out during collapse, and fade in during expansion. To me, this
  enhances the effect of the content rolling away and unrolling again.&#0160;The
  fade effect is more pronounced when there’s a large block of content.

    >Aside: I&#39;ve invested work in reducing the number of files necessary to
    use controls in the QuickUI Catalog. It used to be the case that several
    files were required to use all the controls, but the whole catalog has been
    consolidated into just one pair of files: quickui.catalog.js and
    quickui.catalog.css. As described on
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/usingCatalog.html"
      >How to use these controls</a
    >, </em
  ><em
    >you can include that pair of files directly. You can also follow the
    instructions for cloning the quickui-catalog repo and choosing the specific
    controls you want. Among other things, this makes it easier to try out the
    controls. For example, here&#39;s a
