  Apps often need to pop up something over the main UI; common examples would be
  menus and dialogs. Unfortunately, while apps need popups,
  <em>documents</em> don’t, and until recently HTML was relentlessly
  document-focused. It’s frustratingly difficult to do a popup well in a
  contemporary web app, and so it’s not surprising to see so many apps do them
  poorly or inconsistently.
</p>
<p>
  As a case in point, consider the ways a user might want to dismiss a UI
  element which has popped up over the main UI. Depending on the specific form
  of popup, there are a surprisingly large number of methods the popup might
  support for leaving it:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Click outside the popup. </strong>This is the most common means to
    dismiss a lightweight popup like a menu. The user is saying, “I see you,
    popup, but don’t want to interact with you; let me get back to the main UI.”
    When the user clicks on the main UI in the background, a key question
    arises: <em>what happens with that click?</em> This isn’t an easy question
    to answer; see below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Click inside it. </strong>Perhaps the user has hovered into an
    element that’s popped up a tooltip, and maybe the tooltip’s under the mouse.
    If the tooltip is nothing but static content, the user can generally click
    anywhere within the popup to dismiss it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make a selection</strong>. This is a special case of the above
    point. If the user’s dropped down a combo box and has clicked in an item in
    the resulting list, they’re not only making a selection,&#0160;they’re also
    saying they’re done with the dropdown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Click a button</strong>&#0160;that explicitly indicates completion.
    Another special case of point #3. A classic example would be an OK button in
    a modal dialog, which is essentially a heavyweight form of popup.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Click a close box.</strong>&#0160;A modeless dialog or persistent
    palette window often relies on a small “<strong>×</strong>” icon in the
    upper-right corner as the primary means to dismiss it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Press Esc.</strong> Popups of many flavors can be dismissed by
    pressing the Escape key.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wait.</strong>&#0160;A tooltip or
    <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2012/01/transientmessage.html"
      >transient message</a
    >
    may go away all on its own after giving the user time to read its contents.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hover into another control that produces a popup.</strong> The
    classic example here is menu riffing in Windows or OS/X menu bar. The user
    must click a menu to open it, but once that first menu is opened, the user
    can open the next menu simply by hovering into it. (This aspect of menus is
    worth a closer look in a subsequent blog post.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Move the focus to another window.</strong> Most forms of pop ups are
    temporary enough that the user doesn’t expect them to stick around. If the
    user opens a right-click context menu in Google Docs, and then switches to
    work in a different window, they don’t expect to come back to Google Docs
    later and find the context menu still open.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Press the ALT key.</strong> On Windows, the ALT key or (considerably
    more obscurely) Shift+F10 are used as the keyboard shortcuts to activate the
    menu bar (or, in some cases, the selection’s context menu). If the user
    already has a menu or other popup open, this generally dismisses the popup
    before activating the menu bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scroll the page with the mouse wheel.</strong> Some apps handle
    this, some don’t. But if a tooltip or context menu was invoked from
    something that’s being scrolled out of view, there’s probably no reason for
    the popup to remain open.<br />
    <br /><em
      >[… Are there other ways? There are a wide range of other user actions
      that could dismiss a popup, but the others I can think of close the popup
      as a side effect of a click outside the popup or a loss of window
      focus</em
    ><em>.]</em>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Most web apps that create popups seem to consider only a small fraction of
  these cases. For example, it’s common to have a web app’s menu stay open even
  when the Escape key is pressed (point #6 above) or the tab or window has lost
  focus (#9 above).
</p>
<p>
  Some of the above cases have complexities that get overlooked. Point #1 above
  — handling a click outside the popup — raises the question of what should
  happen with that outside click. The choices are: a) absorb the click so that
  it has no effect other than closing the popup, or b) let the click affect as
  usual whatever element outside the popup the user clicked on. On the web, the
  latter choice can be easier to handle, but this raises a significant usability
  risk: if the user clicks outside a menu, and just so happens to do so by
  clicking on a link, do they really intend to trigger the link’s normal
  navigational response?
</p>
<p>
  As an illustration, suppose a Facebook user has dropped down the menu on the
  right side of their current toolbar, and then they decide to close the menu by
  clicking outside it:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e201676427a8be970b-pi"
    ><img src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201676427a92c970b-pi.png"
  /></a>
  <br /><em>Careful!</em>
</p>
<p>
  That click outside the menu isn’t just going to dismiss the menu—the click is
  also going to activate the partially obscured “app request” link. If the mouse
  were just a few pixels lower, the user would end up launching the process to
  create an ad.
</p>
<p>
  Most OSes and client apps will absorb a click made outside a popup like a menu
  so that the user doesn’t accidentally trigger an unintended action. Web apps
  usually <em>don’t</em> absorb the click. It’s hard to know whether this is
  intentional or not. I think it’s simply a reflection of the fact that
  absorbing the outside click in a web app takes more effort. I personally think
  that effort is worth the trouble to avoid usability issues that can arise if,
  in the course of dismissing a popup, the user ends up accidentally triggering
  a background UI element. I think that work is even more worthwhile if it can
  be folded into a shareable component so that most designers and developers
  don’t have to ever think about this issue.
</p>
<p>
  Related to the concept of a popup is that of an overlay. To help the user see
  a heavyweight popup like a modal dialog, many web apps display a “lightbox
  effect” or other visual treatment. This layer sits visually behind the popup
  but <em>over</em> the main UI in the background. This overlay is really a
  distinct UI element, albeit one whose existence is probably seldom noticed.
  The overlay may not even be visible — it may be entirely transparent! But a
  transparent overlay is precisely the means one would typically use to absorb
  clicks outside a popup: a click on the overlay prevents the click from
  reaching a UI element in the background.
</p>
<p><strong>The Popup control and its related classes</strong></p>
<p>
  Over the past week, I’ve overhauled the
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/Popup">Popup</a> base class as part of
  work towards a new Menu control. One of my goals was to create a base class
  that handled more of the cases above automatically. For example, I wanted a
  Popup to absorb outside clicks by default so that most designers won’t have to
  even think about this, while still leaving the option of letting the outside
  click go through if the designer really wants that behavior. Similarly, I
  wanted the various Popup subclasses (like
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/Dialog">Dialog</a>) and related classes to
  handle their respective situations better so that anyone using them has an
  edge in producing UI with good usability.
</p>
<p>
  The base Popup class now gives the designer and developer the ability to
  smoothly handle many of the dismissal cases above: outside click, inside
  click, loss of window focus, pressing Esc, etc. Special cases like menu bar
  hover behavior can be addressed in subclasses (like the forthcoming Menu
  control).
</p>
<p>
  A Popup control will normally create a companion overlay control to absorb
  outside clicks. This overlay is generally an instance of the&#0160;<a
    href="http://quickui.org/catalog/Overlay"
    >Overlay</a
  >&#0160;class. By default, the first click on an overlay dismisses the popup
  and removes the overlay. A subclass called
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ModalOverlay">ModalOverlay</a> can be used
  for modal dialogs that want to absorb <em>all </em>outside clicks (not just
  the first), so as to force the user to explicitly dismiss the dialog. The
  generic appearance of the ModalOverlay class includes a basic lightbox effect.
  A Popup can also be created with no overlay in situations where it’s important
  to let outside clicks have their normal effect.
</p>
<p>
  A related class called
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/PopupSource">PopupSource</a> is available
  for the common case where a persistent UI element (a button, say) invokes an
  attached popup. PopupSource takes care of positioning the popup in relation to
  the button which invokes the popup. If space allows, the popup is shown below
  the button and left-aligned, but if this would cause the popup to extend
  beyond the viewport, the popup may appear above the button or right-aligned as
  necessary. PopupSource is used as the base class for
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ComboBox">ComboBox</a>, so a dropdown
  produced by a combo box may actually drop <em>up</em> if there’s more room
  above the combo box and not enough below. This is standard behavior on client
  OSes, but rare in web sites that have created their own combo box-like
  elements.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>
<p>
  In dealing with popups, one naturally has to dive into the details of how
  browsers render one element on top of the other. In this study I was aided by
  an excellent
  <a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/wiki/Overlapping_And_ZIndex"
    >summary of how DOM elements stack</a
  >. Having read that, it now seems likely to me that any occurrence of the CSS
  rule, “z-index: 1000”, can also be read as, “z-index: I don’t really know how
  this works”.
</p>
<p>
  Predictably, creating a general-purpose Popup class that works reasonably well
  in a wide variety of configurations on all the mainstream browsers entailed a
  substantial amount of testing and debugging. IE8 was particularly problematic
  in this regard.
