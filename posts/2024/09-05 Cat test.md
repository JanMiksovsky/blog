title: Cat test

I want to test RSS-to-Mastodon posting via [MastoFeed](https://mastofeed.org/), so here's a test post with a photo of Mojo, who wants to come inside.

**Update**: I couldn't get MastoFeed to work, and ended up following these instructions for [Pipedream](https://stefanbohacek.com/blog/turn-an-rss-feed-into-a-mastodon-bot/) instead.
