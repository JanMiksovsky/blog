title: Origami language as a complement to HTML/CSS/JS
---

Writing about the incompleteness of HTML/CSS/JS has helped me reframe my [Origami language](https://weborigami.org/language) as a way to complement those native web languages.

People with some experience with HTML and CSS (but maybe not JS) have a world of ideas to share but may struggle with those missing platform pieces. Origami is a small language to round out the standard ones so people can make even cooler sites, especially small and independent sites.

The Origami language is small and focused on common web tasks. I take inspiration from the [core W3C principle of the Rule of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html): choose the _least_ powerful programming language for a given purpose.
