When considering modern web development, I keep two images in mind.

<img src="/images/2024/02/factory.webp" alt="Gleaming Tesla gigafactory with robots and no people">

This factory image captures how many devs seem to approach creating websites: constructing an enormous, gleaming, automated system that can reliably produce incredibly complex artifacts on a massive scale.

<img src="/images/2024/02/artisan.jpg" alt="A potter using their hands to sculpt a clay pot on a wheel">

In contrast, an individual artisan working in a studio directly creates something with simple tools and their own hands. To me this image captures the spirit of #smallweb/#indieweb activity.

My problem is not that factories are always bad and artisans are always good â€” it's that many devs promote the factory approach of web development _regardless of the situation_. "You're creating that pot by hand?!? You fool! You should first create a gleaming pot factory that will make a million pots for you!" That's ridiculous.
