I made a short video walking through how I generate OpenGraph images for the pages on my blog using [Origami](https://weborigami.org).

This video is an experiment. It takes me _ages_ to create polished documentation or videos â€” and that's discouraged me from creating anything at all! I thought I'd try recording a video with only minimal rehearsal and no editing and see if this kind of thing can fill the gap until I can produce something better.
