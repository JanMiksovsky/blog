<p>
  Modern software includes a large and growing class of UIs that in my opinion
  has received insufficient formal recognition. UIs in this class share many
  traits and are distinctly different from the WIMP UIs of the 1980s and 90s.
  The WIMP acronym summarizes the hallmarks of that UI paradigm: WIndows, Icons,
  Menus, and a Pointer (usually a mouse pointer). I've noticed that I now spend
  more and more of my time on UIs that have neither windows, nor icons, nor a
  menu bar, nor a pointer. These clearly aren't WIMP interfaces, so what are
  they?
</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<p>
  <a href="/images/flowstate/media_center_widescreen.jpg"
    ><img
      border="0"
      src="/images/flowstate/media_center_television_scaled.jpg"
      title="Media_center_television_scaled"
      alt="Media_center_television_scaled"
      class="image-full" /></a
  ><br />Microsoft Windows Media Center Edition<br />
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/images/flowstate/jetblue_kiosk_1.jpg"
    ><img
      width="300"
      height="225"
      border="0"
      src="/images/flowstate/jetblue_kiosk_1.jpg"
      title="Jetblue_kiosk_1"
      alt="Jetblue_kiosk_1" /></a
  ><br />JetBlue check-in kiosk (designed by

</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    src="/images/flowstate/cell_phone_app.png"
    title="Cell_phone_app"
    alt="Cell_phone_app"
  /><br />Typical cell phone screen<br />
</p>
<p>
  These UIs cross a diverse range of devices and environments. The first UI is
  for a media hub that is designed to be displayed on a widescreen TV, viewed
  from across a room, and navigated with an IR remote control. The second is for
  a kiosk for checking in at airports. Here the display is of average size, but
  the UI is negotiated with a touch screen. The third screen comes from a cell
  phone. This UI is optimized for a small display size, and is navigated with a
  directional pad.
</p>
<p>
  Despite their different origins and contexts, such UIs nevertheless share many
  traits. Instead of multiple overlapping windows, the UIs show a single page at
  a time that consumes the entire display surface. The user navigates between
  pages in the style of a web browser, and can usually navigate backwards via a
  Back button. A page almost always presents a single task at a time for the
  user to focus on. Often (but not always) the task is stated directly on the
  page. Text, not icons, is generally used to guide the user. (If they're
  present at all, the icons play mostly a decorative role.) There are menus, but
  not the dropdown sort of menu found in a WIMP UI. Instead, these menus are
  lists of buttons that sit directly on the page at all times. In fact, buttons
  are by far the most common control found in such UIs.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, there is no free-form pointer, or at least no dependency on one. You
  could argue that your fingertip is the pointer in a touch screen UI, but in
  practice a well-done touch UI feels completely different to me than a
  mouse-driven one. (E.g., in a touch UI, your finger clicks big fat buttons,
  with none of the dragging, double-clicking, or right-clicking that pervade
  WIMP UIs.) Many of these UIs dispense with a free-form pointer entirely.
  Instead, the user drives a keyboard focus around the screen (usually with a
  directional pad of arrow buttons) and presses a commit button like OK to
  invoke the targeted action.
</p>
<p>
  The commonalities between such UIs are driven by a higher-level fact: they are
  meant to help users accomplish very specific tasks immediately, without any
  training or up-front learning whatsoever. People generally use them in a
  transient wayâ€”they get in, do what they need to do (pick a TV show, check in
  for a flight, make a call), then get out. Users generally don't spend more
  than a few minutes at a time interacting with the UI proper. Even an SMS-crazy
  teen doesn't live all day inside the phone's UI the way some people live
  inside WIMP environments like Microsoft Excel or Adobe After Effects.
</p>
<p>
  UIs like the ones above form an important class of UI, yet this class seems to
  have received little or no formal recognition. I don't think there's even a
  commonly-accepted term for this paradigm. To facilitate discussions with my
  colleagues, I coined the acronym BBOP (&quot;bebop&quot;) to refer to such
  user interfaces. In the spirit of WIMP, the term BBOP summarizes the
  paradigm's hallmarks:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>B</strong>uttons (as the predominant control type)<br /><strong
      >B</strong
    >ack stack (as a organizing principle for navigation)<br /><strong>O</strong
    >ne Task (one task at a time, often explicitly stated)<br /><strong
      >P</strong
    >age-based (a single page consumes the entire visible screen area)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Once we had a term for this, we began recognizing BBOP UIs in more and more
  places: DVD players, in-car navigation systems, iPods, and so on. I'm
  personally hoping to see more discussion and analysis of BBOP UIs (or whatever
  they end up being called) in the future. Even more, I'm hoping to see better
  support in UI platforms for creating them.<br />
