<p>
  We launched this Component Kitchen site in April 2014 with a web component
  catalog as its centerpiece. Today we&#39;re shutting down that catalog so we
  can focus on web component consulting and our open web components projects,
  including the
  <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki"
    >Gold Standard Checklist for Web Components</a
  >
  and the general-purpose
  <a href="https://github.com/basic-web-components/basic-web-components"
    >Basic Web Components</a
  >
  library.
</p>
<p>
  Running the component catalog was a great way to learn about building
  production applications using web components and Google&#39;s Polymer library.
  But we&#39;ve come to feel that the catalog&#39;s utility is limited, and it
  no longer makes economic sense to continue it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      As in any online space, much of what is freely given publicly is,
      unfortunately, junk. Many registered components are &quot;Hello,
      world!&quot;, or trivial wrappers of a third-party library, or utilities
      so specialized as to be useful to no one but their authors. That makes it
      hard to find something worth using.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Even potentially useful components are seldom written at a level of
      production quality. We tried to start a &quot;component of the week&quot;
      blog post series in late 2014. We would sift through a dozen components
      just to find one that even <em>worked</em> outside the narrow confines of
      its demo. This isn&#39;t necessarily the fault of the component authors —
      it&#39;s really hard to write a solid web component today. (That&#39;s one
      reason we believe that establishing a Gold Standard for web component
      quality is a vital project.) We also believe that the web user interface
      framework vendors, such as Polymer and X-Tag, need to invest more heavily
      in making it easy to create components that meet that standard.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Our catalog pages showed GitHub stars, but the direct GitHub metadata for
      projects like web components isn&#39;t all that useful in assessing a
      project&#39;s quality. A GitHub star doesn&#39;t tell you whether anyone
      has actually tried a project, whether they thought it was good, whether
      they used it, or whether they&#39;re still using it. We have some ideas
      for how to compile better indications of a web component project&#39;s
      utility, but they would require a larger investment of our resources than
      we can afford.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      People want to see a component project&#39;s own documentation, not a
      third-party repackaging of that documentation. We think that&#39;s true
      for any online catalog, including successful ones like npm. When we find a
      package on npm, we never read the package details there, because we&#39;ll
      have to go to the actual GitHub repository to form an assessment of
      whether it&#39;s worth actually trying the package.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      GitHub itself could easily improve its own search and ranking features to
      the point where external catalogs would struggle to add value. We&#39;d
      rather not compete with them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As a result of the above points, if you want to find a foobar web
      component, it&#39;s easier to google for &quot;foobar web component&quot;
      than to consult a purpose-built catalog. If you follow the search results
      to GitHub, you&#39;ll end up where you wanted to go anyway.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It turns out that a coherent <em>collection</em> of components designed
      and implemented together is more interesting than individual components
      from multiple authors. While we had plans to feature component
      collections, we didn&#39;t think the payoff would be high enough. Again,
      the collection creator is more interested in driving traffic to their
      collection&#39;s own site, and that&#39;s probably what the component
      customer is interested in seeing too.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Retiring the catalog lets us invest more time in the projects that we think
  matter more. People who want a component catalog can use
  <a href="https://customelements.io/">customelements.io</a>, which has seen
  many improvements lately. Also, as a service to people who have made deep
  links to our catalog&#39;s component pages, for the indefinite future we will
  continue to serve up tombstone pages at those URLs that offer a link to the
  corresponding repository on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
  When we started our catalog, there were only about 40 publicly registered web
  components — now the number is in the thousands. We really appreciate all of
  the people who visited our catalog in the last year and a half, who built a
  great component we could feature, and who took the time to give us feedback or
  a shout-out on social sites. We&#39;re still excited to be working in this
  transformative web components space, and look forward to sharing our ongoing
  work here soon.
