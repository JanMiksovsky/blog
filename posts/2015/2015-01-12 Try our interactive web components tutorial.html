<p>
  We've just posted an
  <a href="/tutorial">interactive web components tutorial</a>
  that teaches the basic concepts with editable live demos. We hope you'll find
  that this tutorial:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explains the key principles at a quick pace under your control.</li>
  <li>
    Illustrates the principles through engaging, live HTML demos. We think the
    best way to learn a technology is to play with it yourself!
  </li>
  <li>
    Introduces concepts from the perspective of the component user. Most web
    component presentations start with the assumption that you're a developer
    creating a component from scratch. But one of the great things about web
    components is that components can be <em>used</em> by a wider audience than
    the people who can <em>create</em> components.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only requires knowledge of HTML. If you're one of the many people who has
    read or written HTML, but don't consider yourself to be a developer, this is
    the tutorial for you. And if you are a developer, we still think this
    presents the concepts in an approchable and useful manner.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Please check it out, share it, and let us know what you think!</p>
