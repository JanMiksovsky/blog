<p>
  Wouldn’t it incredibly helpful if we had a library of components providing
  solid implementations for all the common, general-purpose, well-designed user
  interface patterns found in mobile and web apps? In such a library, how many
  components would there even be?
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of the exact number, I think it’s clear that a comprehensive set of
  such patterns would be much larger than what’s available in most UI component
  libraries. Why is that are most existing UI libraries so <em>small</em>?
</p>
<p>
  There are a few different kinds of UI libraries; let’s look at each in turn.
</p>
<h2><strong>Operating system UI libraries</strong></h2>
<p>
  Every software operating system (Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, etc.) offers a
  library of user interface components. These help the platform’s developers be
  more efficient — but more critically, these libraries establish the visual and
  behavior language for their respective platforms. That is, they provide
  sufficient components such that native and third-party apps can present
  customers a reasonably consistent user experience.
</p>
<p>
  OS UI libraries usually aren’t that big, though, often something in the
  neighborhood of 20–40 components. These include components for tried-and-true
  UI patterns: check boxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, tabs, menu bars,
  sliders, progress indicators, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  But OS UI libraries seldom go far beyond that. Once the platform has been
  established, the platform vendor has little incentive to invest more work in
  their platform’s UI component library. When my startup began working on an iOS
  app, for example, I was stunned to discover just how few of the conventions of
  that platform were directly facilitated by iOS itself.
</p>
<p>
  Even when an innovation such as, say, pull-to-refresh emerges in a mobile app
  like Tweetie and is widely emulated to the point where it becomes a de facto
  mobile UI standard, the UI innovation rarely makes it back into the platform
  itself. If it does make it into the platform, that step usually takes a very
  long time. Tweetie came out in 2008. Apple finally added UIRefreshControl to
  iOS 6 in 2012 — an eon later in mobile Internet time.
</p>
<p>
  Another reason why OS libraries may have been so limited historically is that
  theming native UI components has been hard. Many operating systems conflate UI
  component appearance with component behavior, so it’s impossible (or hard) to
  get something that behaves just like a standard toolbar (with docking, etc.),
  but looks significantly different. And once you get much more complex than,
  say, a text box, a designer wants more control over visual appearance. To get
  a visually distinct result, the developer usually have to build something from
  scratch. The web has an advantage here with CSS, which helps separate
  presentation from structure and behavior. So you’d think web UI libraries
  would be bigger — but they’re usually not.
</p>
<h2><strong>General-purpose web UI libraries</strong></h2>
<p>
  Web UI libraries (e.g., jQuery UI) operate under different constraints.
  They’re not really focused on ensuring a consistent user experience; even if a
  library is pretty successful, it’s still unlikely to significantly impact the
  user experience of the web at large. Rather, the primary goal of most web UI
  libraries is increasing developer efficiency. Devs don’t want to spend time
  rewriting modal dialog logic that’s been written many times before; a library
  providing a pre-authored dialog component can help them create dialogs more
  quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Curiously, most web UI libraries still still end up with about the same number
  of 20–40 components as platform libraries. Possible explanations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Web libraries follow the example of platform libraries. It is turns out to
    be quite hard to think systematically about a large realm of user interfaces
    and identify the best decomposition of atomic elements that could most
    efficiently recreate it from scratch. It’s easier to emulate a set of
    elements someone else has already worked out in other UI libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    The limitations of HTML itself and the legacy of browser incompatibility
    have heretofore constrained the set of interesting components which can be
    created and easily integrated into other applications. These limitations
    have dampened the network effects required for a large component collection
    to gain critical mass.
  </li>
  <li>
    The cost of maintaining the existing components increases with the number of
    components. By the time a library approaches a few dozen components, a small
    project’s entire bandwidth may be consumed by ongoing maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>
    It becomes harder to maintain a library’s internal consistency with each
    additional component. A library&#39;s authors want consistent
    implementations and public APIs across all components in the library.
    Occasionally a new component forces reconsideration of the existing
    components, necessitating refactoring. Eventually the cost of adding a new
    component may become prohibitive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating solid, general-purpose UI components is unglamorous, tiresome, and
    thankless work. Oh, and unprofitable, too.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The answer may be some combination of these factors, but that doesn’t make the
  result any more satisfying. It’s still frustrating that no open web UI library
  is really comprehensive. The last three points, in particular, all apply
  equally well to any open web library operating below the level of the visible
  UI, and many of those have grown quite large.
</p>
<h2><strong>Framework sample UI libraries</strong></h2>
<p>
  Some web UI libraries exist for a different reason: to provide samples of
  components which can be built with a given web framework. Components in such
  libraries effectively serve as framework documentation, and also as test cases
  for the framework. Their ability to simply function is what ensures other devs
  can build interesting, functioning components with the framework. While a few
  people may find the components interesting to use in their own right, that’s
  not really their main purpose.
</p>
<p>
  To these ends, sample components tend to be somewhat specialized in their
  purpose. The trouble with creatint really good general-purpose UI components
  as sample is that such components are often fiendishly complex under the hood.
  They must exhaustively cover a wide range of configurations and edge cases,
  and such complexity can obscure or confuse the use of the underlying
  framework, which is the primary goal of the library. The result is that sample
  components tend to look visually interesting, but often aren’t directly
  reusable.
</p>
<p>
  In any event, here again we see a fairly small number of components. Once the
  framework developers have delivered 10–20 examples, they may have already
  achieved good coverage of the framework’s features and provided ample sample
  code, so there’s little incentive to invest in creating more components.
</p>
<h2><strong>Why can’t we just do all the common UI patterns?</strong></h2>
<p>
  I think a compelling criteria for a open web UI library would be to say:
  &quot;This library tries to provide all the UI patterns in widespread use on
  the web.&quot; That is, if a UI pattern appears in some reasonably interesting
  percentage of popular apps, then the library should provide a component
  delivering a solid baseline implementation of that UI pattern.
</p>
<p>
  A comprehensive web UI component library sounds ambitious, but it’s not crazy.
  It&#39;s probably only an order of magnitude bigger than the tens of
  components in the OS and web UI libraries described above.
</p>
<p>
  When I first started on the
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</a>, my hope was to
  eventually create exactly that: a home for solid implementations of all common
  UI patterns. For a while now I’ve been looking at the emerging collection of
  web component technology standards to see if they can provide a good substrate
  for such a collection. The technologies are still coming together, but it now
  appears likely that a comprehensive UI library could indeed be delivered as
  standard web components. In the short term at least, such a library would need
  to be augmented with Google’s innovative and compelling
  <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer project</a>, which allows
  new web technologies like custom elements to function on older browsers.
</p>
<h2><strong>Compiling a comprehensive list of UI patterns</strong></h2>
<p>
  To help make the case a comprehensive UI library is achievable, I’ve been
  compiling a list of every UI pattern I can find that seems common,
  general-purpose, and well-designed. Some notes on these criteria:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Common: the UI pattern has to be something you encounter in multiple
    apps/sites. If a particular app invents some clever bit of UI, but it’s so
    unique to the app’s context that it’s not used (or can’t be used) elsewhere,
    it doesn’t belong in the library.
  </li>
  <li>
    General-purpose: the pattern has to be applicable in multiple contexts and
    interesting in a range of products. Broadly speaking, this criteria
    generally excludes components which are directly bound to a proprietary web
    service. While a Facebook Like button component is certainly interesting and
    common, it’s tied to Facebook’s backend, and hence (in this context) not
    considered general purpose. In contrast, a UI component that shows blog
    headlines via RSS <em>is</em> defined as general purpose, because it can be
    used with any backend supporting RSS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Well-designed. There are some common, general-purpose UI patterns that also
    happen to be terrible. There’s no need to make these more prevalent.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Beyond conventional web UI patterns, I want this list to include mobile UI
  patterns, even those typically implemented in native code. My belief is that a
  mobile web app should be able to do anything a native mobile app can do, so
  I’d prefer to include (native) mobile UI patterns from the start.
</p>
<p>
  This list comes from direct experience, as well as combing through various
  collections of UI patterns on the web. It’s by no means complete, but I think
  it can already serve to help estimate the initial size of such a library.

<h2><strong>This seems totally doable</strong></h2>
<p>
  Okay, so there’s a little over 100 UI patterns in this list, suggesting that a
  comprehensive, general-purpose web UI library would contain a number of
  components of that order. (Some patterns may require implementation as
  multiple components.) You and I will likely disagree about the correct
  decomposition of a given UI into a set of patterns, or about the best way to
  implement a pattern with components, or about what everything should be
  called, but I’m guessing that debate won’t change the size of the list much.
</p>
<p>
  More eyes on the problem — more people looking for common, general-purpose UI
  components — would certainly increase the size of the list, but probably not
  too much. For argument’s sake, let’s assume the list above captures little
  more than half of the general-purpose UI components the library should
  ultimately deliver. That still puts the list at only 200 components. My
  instinct is that any organizational strategy that can produce a library of 100
  components can also produce 200 components.
</p>
<p>
  There’s clearly some kind of existing inflection point when a library reaches
  approximately 40 components, or else we would see more libraries with more
  components. But I’m hoping the next inflection point won’t be reached until a
  much higher number of components. Specifically, it’s my contention that the
  apparent barrier of 40 components in a UI library can be breached with network

  That is, a key limiting factor to date which has prevent a comprehensive UI
  library (or marketplace, or ecosystem, whatever) has been the inability for
  one group to benefit from another group’s UI work. I hope web components,
  seeded with efforts like Polymer, will change this dynamic, enabling us to
  blow through this barrier and create easily sharable solutions to common UI
  patterns. As I’ve often said before, that will allow us to stop burning so
  much time reinventing things, and focus more of our precious time on
  delivering value unique to our apps.
