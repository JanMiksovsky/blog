  Cozi is expanding its family software to the mobile domain. We have a
  <a

    >Cozi iPhone application</a
  >, and are obviously looking at Android as well. The problem is what to do
  about Blackberry, Palm webOS, and perhaps Windows Phone 7. As an entrepreneur
  with friends at two of those companies, I wish good luck to those OSes in
  third place and beyond. As a designer of family software, I have a goal to
  address the needs of my users, and support whatever phone they find meets
  their needs. And as an executive at a company that makes mobile phone
  applications, I wish those OSes in third place and beyond would please die—and
  soon, if they wouldn’t mind.

  As an ISV working on top of a platform, I want exactly two platform providers.
  Not one, not three, or four, or ten. Two. If there’s only one platform
  provider, the provider inevitably becomes arrogant and insensitive to the
  needs of the ISVs that keep it alive. Not three, or four, or more—those
  platforms can never get enough market share to make it worth your while. All
  they will do is produce enough users to make your life miserable with endless
  requests for when you’ll get around to supporting the OS they prefer, with its
  3% market share. The only good case with the smaller players is if they can
  become commoditized, ideally in combination with the first or (more likely)
  second place platform, in which case their existence makes no difference to
  the ISV.
</p>
<p>
  An ISV wants exactly two platform providers in any given space. The first one
  can be the successful one, with something like 70% market share. The second
  one can be the underdog, with 25% market share. From the ISV’s perspective,
  the underdog’s job is to keep the top dog honest, while maintaining sufficient
  market share to justify the ISV’s investment developing for that platform.
  Without the latter justification, the ISV can’t justify the investment, which
  means the underdog eventually loses compelling apps, and loses market share
  until they can no longer play a meaningful role as underdog. The remaining 5%
  of the market should be splintered among tiny players. None of them should
  have sufficient market share to create a compelling business case to the ISV,
  so the ISV can focus on the two players that really matter.
</p>
<p>This effect has been demonstrated over and over again.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the golden age of personal computer OSes, the Mac had just enough market
    share to be worth developing for, which kept Microsoft honest. When the Mac
    nearly became irrelevant, Microsoft slowed its pace of innovation, and took
    forever to release Vista. Without OS/X nipping at its heels, it’s
    exceedingly unlikely that Microsoft would have gone on to produce a nice
    Windows 7. Thankfully, a personal computer OS is now largely a commodity
    whose greatest purpose is to run a web browser, and web-based ISVs can often
    ignore the space entirely.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the gaming console space, game ISVs resent Nintendo’s steadfast refusal
    to die. Microsoft and Sony can keep each other honest on their own. So, from
    a game developer’s perspective, Nintendo’s existence doesn’t improve their
    life, it only complicates it.
  </li>
  <li>
    When Microsoft maneuvered IE into a position of browser dominance, ISVs had
    no choice but to optimize for IE, giving Microsoft so much market power that
    they could ignore the call to adopt standards. When Mozilla, Chrome, and
    Safari eventually became clawed their way to being good enough and
    threatening enough, Microsoft finally had to get serious again about making
    IE good. In this particular case, web standardization has commoditized the
    smaller players, so as an ISV, I really don’t care whether Mozilla and
    WebKit both stick around. All that matters is that, collectively, they can
    force Microsoft to improve.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now, the mobile OS space is increasingly dominated by iOS and Android. To an
  ISV, that’s fantastic news! The fewer players, the less work the mobile ISV
  has to do to reach more users. I’m really hoping Android manages to create a
  meaningful application marketplace and sustain fast growth. When iPhone was
  the sole high-end mobile OS of interest, they could afford to subjugate ISVs
  with completely mysterious and arbitrary rules for who could be in the App
  Store. With Android on the rise, Apple has been finally forced to

    >open up a bit</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The mobile ISV wants to see that tussle between Apple and Android. But what
  would really make me happy would be to see those other guys get a lot weaker.
  The other mobile OS providers don’t weigh enough on their own, and hence can
  only serve to make the ISV’s life harder. Hey, you guys can all share that
  last 5%!
