  Like a lot of iPhone users, I was surprised that Apple changed the behavior of
  double-click the Home button in iOS 4.0. That action had previously taken the
  user to a user-selected favorite application, which by default was the Phone
  application. On a phone with a tiny number of hardware buttons, having a fast
  way to actually make a phone call seems like a good idea. In iOS 4.0, this
  double-click&#0160;action was redefined to invoke the task switching UI:

</p>
<p>
  I happen find the new behavior fine, and find a use for it many more times a
  day than I did the previous behavior. Some number of users, however, howled
  when they upgraded their phones and found a favorite feature was missing.
  Apple essentially took a feature away, an occasion so rare in software design
  that I can only think of a handful of cases in more than twenty years where
  I’ve done it myself.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of what one thinks about Apple’s decision, I’m impressed by their
  resolve to retire the old behavior. Features tend to live forever, sometimes
  out of all proportion to their utility. It’s usually cheaper to keep things
  than get rid of them, and as this case shows, every feature has at least some
  number of users that will be inconvenienced and upset if the feature were to
  be removed. Some of the most passionate of those feature users may, in fact,
  work on the team that make the product, and those people serve as advocates to
  ensure the conservation of old features.
</p>
<p>
  Usually, the tendency to conserve features is so strong that old features are
  usually buried as settings, rather than eliminated entirely. When Microsoft
  finally
  <a

    >fixed the behavior of the Insert key in Microsoft Word</a
  >, it still preserved the old behavior as a behavior preference. Here it would
  presumably have been trivial for Apple to keep the old behavior<em
    >&#0160;by simply folding the new behavior into the very configuration UI it
    replaced</em
  >. That is, the list in the image on the left above could have been extended
  with a new option to “Switch applications”, and that option could have been
  made the default. Given the low cost of doing that, Apple’s decision to retire
  the old behavior is even more impressive—or, depending upon your point of
  view, more reprehensible.
</p>
<p>
  The complexities of preserving such behavior preferences in perpetuity is one
  of the many reasons I personally try very, very hard to avoid introducing them
  in the first place.
