  This past weekend I had a lot of fun giving a talk at
  <a href="http://www.seattle20.com/startupday/">StartupDay</a> 2010 on the
  topic of user experience design in the context of a startup company. After my
  talk, I volunteered my time at a table in the advisory area, where lawyers,
  VCs, and various experts on others topics of interest met with new and hopeful
  entrepreneurs. I ended up spending time with four entrepreneurs, and three of
  them asked the exact same question:
  <strong>Where can I find budget design talent?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  I really wanted to help these people get their business started, so did my
  best to come up with a meaningful suggestion. They all liked my advice, so I
  want to share it with you too:
  <strong>Try finding a college student to do your design project.</strong>

</p>
<p>There are a bunch of good reasons to hire a college student:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    There are incredibly talented undergraduate and graduate students studying
    every form of design that’s out there.
  </li>
  <li>
    They are looking for a job that pays better than part-time work in the
    campus library or a local restaurant, and so are willing to work for less
    money than you might imagine. (That said: Be fair.)
  </li>
  <li>
    They want to build a portfolio. The extent to which your design project is
    actually interesting increases the chance the result of the project will
    look good in their portfolio. This portfolio benefit can translate into more
    motivation (and possibly willingness to work for less).
  </li>
  <li>They can have drive and energy to spare.</li>
  <li>
    Instructors want their students to work on real-world problems! I’ve been
    approached in the past by professors looking for projects for their
    students. They are farming out cheap (or free) labor, but don’t always know
    who’s looking for design work, and may not have local small-company
    connections. These engagements can come with particular constraints: the
    project probably needs to start and end within a given semester, you may be
    obligated to submit an evaluation at the end of the project, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the relationship works well, you can use them for future projects, or
    potentially recruit them. You may discover someone great before anyone else
    does!
  </li>
  <li>This is a way of doing some good in the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The obvious downsides to hiring a college student for a real business project
  are lack of experience: specifically in the particular design discipline
  you’re looking to hire, and generally as a professional with business
  responsibilities. They may not yet have worked on a project for which failure
  can entail consequences worse than a bad grade.
</p>
<p>
  It can also be hard to find a good student—it takes time to separate the wheat
  from the chaff—but if you’re on a&#0160; budget, it may be worth the extra
  time. And if you’re on a really tight budget, you may have no better option.
</p>
<p>
  Reaching out to local instructors can be a good place to start; even if they
  don’t have a specific work/study project coming up (or one that matches your
  parameters), they may know current or past students that might be good for
  your project. These instructors can be found not only at the local college or
  university, but also at trade schools and other adult learning institutions.
