<p>
  A recent Cozi usability study offered an interesting example of the
  paternalism latent in the task of designing something for someone else. In
  short, a designer is often required to make decisions which are directly
  counter to the requests of some of their users.
</p>
<p>
  The usability subject in this study was an avid user of Apple iCal. A
  particular iCal feature which they repeatedly praised was its ability to show
  color-coded appointments in Month view. In contrast, Cozi’s Month view eschews
  our own color-coding scheme (which we use in our Week view and our new Day
  view) and presents all appointments in monochrome.

</p>
<p>
  The iCal user insisted that they required a Month view with color-coding. They
  found other Cozi features like liked, but they repeatedly dinged Cozi for the
  lack of color in Month view. At the end of the study, when asked if they had
  any general comments to offer on Cozi, they returned to this point. And then a
  curious thing happened. As they flipped between Apple iCal and Cozi to make
  their point, they stopped on the Cozi calendar. They paused, then slowly
  began:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Hmm… you know, now that I look at the two calendars side by side, there
    <em>is</em> something about the Cozi calendar. It’s cleaner…
  </p>
  <p>“Gosh, all that color is really kind of distracting.</p>
  <p>
    “I guess it’s easier to read the calendar without all that color. And
    because the one-time appointments are in bold, I can really see the stuff I
    need to pay attention to…
  </p>
  <p>
    “Okay, I’m going to take back everything I said. I like the Cozi calendar
    better. Maybe if I had been using Cozi’s calendar,
    <em>I wouldn’t have missed this usability study scheduled today.</em>”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This was the clincher. The user had in fact been completely surprised at the
  beginning of the appointed study time we had scheduled with them, even though
  we could see they had the usability study appointment on their iCal calendar.
  They had completely missed it in the rainbow of color.
</p>
<p>
  Design requires a degree of paternalism. The word has an unfortunate nuance;
  adult users are not children, and not to be treated as such. But there is
  nevertheless something about listening and responding to user feedback that
  mimics the way a parent listens and responds to requests from their children.
  A child may ask for all kinds of things that the parent judges to be counter
  to the short and long term interests of the child, the parent, the family, or
  society. Due to cognitive or developmental limitations, the child may not be
  able to arrive at the same point of view, or at least not at that time.
</p>
<p>
  Adult users are constrained by different forces. They are extremely busy, and
  don’t have the time, skills, energy, or interest to pursue a particular point
  of feedback to its logical conclusion. They use a product, something about it
  differs from their expectations, a response pops into their head, and they
  voice it—sometimes strenuously.
</p>
<p>
  That feedback has to be taken seriously, but not slavishly. Many, many users
  have similarly demanded that Cozi’s Month view show color-coding. It’s a
  reasonable request, which of course we have considered closely. From the
  earliest days of work on our calendar, we have tried various approaches to
  introduce color coding into Month view. (Cozi has the the additional challenge
  of showing a single family appointment that involves multiple users, each with
  their own color.) To date, none of our design experiments with color-coding in
  Month view have satisfied us.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe someday we’ll crack the design problem, and delight that we can finally
  give these users what they’ve been asking for. In the meantime, the
  consequences of following through on that feedback would so compromise the
  legibility of the calendar that we think it would represent a net loss in
  utility. (Offering color-coding in Month view via an option is another story,
  but the short answer there is that such options compromise things in a
  different way.)
</p>
<p>
  An individual user doesn’t have anywhere near the time (or, likely, the
  ability) to perform these design explorations on their own, or even to find
  and read through arguments like this one here as to why we’ve done what we’ve
  done. In the end, we make a conscious, paternalistic decision not to give them
  the very thing they’re asking for. We trust in our own judgment, then look for
  research like this usability study to confirm that we’ve made the right call.
