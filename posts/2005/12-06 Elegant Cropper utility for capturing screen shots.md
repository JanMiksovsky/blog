  A helpful reader recently pointed me at the handy

  One of the most time-consuming tasks in creating a post for this blog is
  capturing small images of UI examples. For certain jobs, Cropper lets me
  perform this task more quickly than other tools I've used. (<a

  alpha-blended overlay technique for marking the crop boundaries is elegant,
  and its keyboard support allows you to tweak the position and size of the
  captured image.
