  I've noticed that a previously answered question has recently become open
  again: where does a typical user place their threshold for a download that's
  too big?
</p>
<p>
  Companies that distribute client software via a web download used to agonize
  over how to reduce their download size in order to encourage adoption. Browser
  developers in particular used to crow about how their download was smaller
  than their competitors. This was a big deal in the days of dialup. If I
  recall, a rule of thumb in the mid 90s held that each 1MB of download would
  take 10 minutes over a typical dialup connection of that period. Worse, dialup
  connections could easily fail, forcing the user to sit through the long
  download again. A user who had to devote an hour of their life to babysit your
  6MB download was quite cautious about clicking the &quot;Download Now&quot;
  button. The user was also concerned about how much disk space your product
  would ultimately eat up was everything was installed.
</p>
<p>
  The relevant factors have changed significantly: many users have broadband
  connections, download managers exist to cope with flaky connections, and hard
  drive space is easy enough to come by. Many companies now seem to pay scant
  attention to their download size, so I can only assume many users don't care
  either. Download Adobe's Reader product (a business requirement these days)
  and you'll see a lightning quick 500K download... of Adobe's Download Manager,
  which then brings down another 80MB or so of software—including some other
  Adobe products slipped in for good measure.
</p>
<p>
  One reason this question is interesting to client software designers is that
  there are some pretty interesting client runtimes coming down the pike that
  open up some great UI possibilities at the expense of download and install
  size. The forthcoming .NET Framework version 2.0 package is 22MB. The Windows
  Presentation Foundation (&quot;Avalon&quot;) or Windows Communcation
  Foundation (&quot;Indigo&quot;) add more on top of that. If you're building a
  product that itself already depends on broadband use, does the download size
  of your client even matter at all? If anyone has actual, recent data (not
  anecdotal experiences) on how todays user's react to download size, I'm
  interested in hearing it.
