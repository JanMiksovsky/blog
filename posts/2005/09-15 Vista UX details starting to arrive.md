  As part of Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference 2005, the company
  has released more information on how to design user experiences for Windows
  Vista. I was the UX architect on Vista for a number of years, so it's good to
  see this information finally starting to coming into the light of day.
</p>
<p>
  (As it turns out, Microsoft has created a remarkably poor user experience for
  reading their guidelines on user experience. You have to go to a section on
  Microsoft's MSDN developers site for the
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/uxguide/"
    >Windows Vista UX Guidelines</a
  >. You need to go through some Windows verification foolishness, although I'm
  baffled why it matters what platform you're using to read the guidelines. You
  then need to <em>download a ZIP file</em>. This ZIP file turns out to
  contain... wait for it... <em>a copy of a web site</em> that describes how to
  design good user experiences. Oh, the irony. The byzantine reasons behind
  Microsoft's web site production process are not worth delving into. Let's just
  say I'm glad I now work at a tiny startup.)
</p>
<p>
  Some of the Vista work I'm most excited to see deals with an effort to bring
  clarity to muddled dialog boxes and wizard pages. Vista offers OS support for
  a new &quot;task dialog&quot; style. This style—and the accompanying
  guidelines—call out a dialog's main question or instruction as a single
  sentence in clear, natural language. (The blurry example JPEG images below
  come straight from the guidelines; too bad they didn't offer lossless PNGs.)
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/aero_dialog.jpg" alt="Aero_dialog" />
</p>
<p>This same task style is reflected in the new standard wizard template:</p>
<p>
  <img alt="Aero_wizard" src="/images/flowstate/aero_wizard.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
  This wizard style is, in fact, an operating system feature designed
  specifically to
  <a href="/posts/2005/08-01-make-every-piece-of-text-count.html"
    >make every piece of text count</a
  >. Gone are the big pointless graphics that took up a third of the page, and a
  single piece of instruction text replaces the old stack of redundant headings.
  Hallelujah. It's gratifying to see the evolution of direct OS support for the
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwui/html/iuiguidelines.asp"
    >inductive UI style</a
  >
  I developed way back in the late 90s for Microsoft Money.
</p>
<p>
  Some Vista UX guidelines are specific to Vista development, but many of them
  make just as much sense for products that ship on Windows XP, OS/X, or Linux.
  Worth a look.
