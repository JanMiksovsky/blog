  An application can engender positive or negative emotions in its users at the
  very earliest point of contact. When interacting with an operating system, the
  earliest point of contact is often the logon UI. The way an OS treats logon UI
  can easily establish a good or bad impression in the user's mind.
</p>
<p>
  A long time ago, if you typed an incorrect password into a Windows logon
  dialog, you'd get something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src="/images/flowstate/incorrect_password.gif"
    alt="Incorrect_password"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Windows is clearly treating the situation as an error and, moreover, it
  clearly thinks the error is the<em> user's</em> fault. Later iterations of the
  OS soften this message somewhat. By Windows 2000, the message changes to:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The system could not log you on. Make sure your User name and pasword are
    correct, then type your password again. Letters in passwords must be typed
    using the correct case.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is a big improvement (not sure why User is capitalized, though), but the
  tone is still stiff and a tad patronizing. By Windows XP's Home edition,
  things become much more conversational:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Did you forget your password?</strong><br />Please type your
    password again.<br />Be sure to use the right uppercase and lowercase
    letters.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This is pretty good, and it's hard to think of how to make this message much
  friendlier. Apple manages to, though, in its OS/X logon dialog. Apple's
  solution deftly finesses the situation by
  <em>avoiding the error message altogether</em>.

  If you don't enter the right password, the dialog literally
  <em>shakes back and forth</em> and the password field is cleared. A couple of
  years ago when a colleague showed this to me, I laughed out loud. The dialog
  is clearly shaking its head to say, &quot;Nope!&quot;, and just as clearly
  letting the user know they have to try again. It does this all in a humorous
  way that engenders a positive emotion in the user and without having to play
  verbal games to avoid assigning blame.
