<p>
  ... so I think I'll get around to starting that UI design blog I've been
  meaning to start. I'd prefer to just read someone else's insightful commentary
  on user interface design, but haven't found much yet on the topic. There are
  sites like <a href="http://www.useit.com">Jakob Nielsen's useit.com</a>, but
  that's primarily about usability and user research, not user interface design.
  There are a few other sites on web UI design, but they generally ignore the
  design of client software UI. To me that's odd, since today the UI of the
  average client application is still far richer and interactive than the UI of
  the average web site. Focusing on web design exclusively is like studying
  architecture and only looking at the design of houses. There should be more
  discussion of the craft of UI, and that discussion should include traditional
  PC client UI as well as web UI, cell phones, etc.

<p>Hence, this blog.</p>
