<p>
  Microsoft Windows Media Center Edition contains a UI nugget worth a close
  look: the My Music area's list of albums includes any CD that happens to be in
  the drive:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Media_center_my_music_showing_inserted_c"
    src="/images/flowstate/media_center_my_music_showing_inserted_c_1.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  This sort of thing looks obvious after the fact, but consider the fact that
  the list is blending data from two completely different sources: 1) Media
  Player's local music database, and 2) whatever CD happens to be inserted in
  the drive. All actions in the UI work essentially the same regardless of what
  kind of item is selected (with the difference that a CD can be ripped).
</p>
<p>
  Faced with this design problem, most teams would have created a UI that
  directly reflected the underlying data model. This would force the user to
  deal with two distinct UI elements: one area for the the albums already in the
  database, and a separate area for the local CD drives. (This is, in fact, what
  Windows Media Player does.)
</p>
<p>
  The Media Center team did a bunch of work to let the user work at the right
  level of abstraction: everything in the list is an album, regardless of
  whether it's ripped yet or not. This sort of thing doesn't come up every day,
  but it's worth thinking about whether your own application could benefit by
  adopting this nice trick.
