  A lot of my time as a design executive is spent defending the value of the
  unquantifiable. Business pressures argue for design compromises with some
  quantifiable and significant ROI (Return on Investment). But as Adaptive Path
  put it in their report on
  <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/ideas/reports/businessvalue"
    >Leveraging Business Value: How ROI Changes User Experience</a
  >, “It’s impossible to measure ROI for user experience with a simple equation
  that can be applied across a wide swath of companies and projects.” And, in my
  experience, perhaps the hardest thing to quantify is the value of negative
  space: the space <em>between</em> your user interface elements.
</p>
<p>
  Typically brand new apps have lots of space, because UI elements represent
  features, which require code, which requires time and money. With time and
  money, however, the app evolves, and the empty space is quickly filled in with
  new features. The availability of room, in fact, can contribute greatly to the
  decision to place a button in what was previously empty space. “Users are
  asking for this feature, and it looks like there’s room for us to squeeze in
  another button on the toolbar, so let’s do the feature and make it a toolbar
  button.”
</p>
<p>
  I rarely hear discussion about setting aside room in a user interface for the
  <em>absence</em> of user interface elements. Speaking both aesthetically and
  from a usability perspective, negative space can be highly valuable in an
  interface. Used effectively, it can create a sense of calm, balance,
  manageability, and competence. It can help guide the user’s eyes across the
  page towards what’s important. The presence of space can separate things that
  are different; the absence of space can join things that are similar.

  Cozi’s current web page template leaves some significant negative space in the
  lower left (above the clock), as well as a bit in the upper right. Both those
  spaces vary in size depending on the window dimensions. (The calendar view
  itself also has considerable space, but that’s highly dependent on which view
  is selected and how much data is on the calendar.)

  The challenge is that negative space doesn’t <em>look</em> like it’s doing
  anything. It can appear inefficient—like a lost opportunity. In a business
  driven by display advertising, there is pressure to make pixels generate
  revenue. It’s nearly impossible to count the value that effective negative
  space contributes to a user experience, but it’s very easy to estimate the
  rent those same pixels might generate if they were converted to display
  advertising inventory. The thing is, those empty pixels <em>are</em> doing
  something. The user experience would be different—worse—if the space were
  filled.

  (The Leaderboard ad in the image above is actually a different problem. That
  ad isn’t filling space that was previously empty; it’s consuming space that
  would otherwise be used to show user data. See my earlier post on why
  <a

    >it’s easier for users to image hiding an ad than completely redesigning a
    UI</a
  >.)

  Negative space is hard concept to love, but it turns out that most people
  demonstrate an intuitive grasp of negative space in the context of their own
  homes. In home after home, you can observe that the occupants have very
  carefully hung pictures or paintings on the wall so as to give each piece
  space to breathe. You will rarely see a bunch of paintings crammed together on
  a wall. Most people effectively use negative space with no training beyond the
  casual observations of positive examples in other homes, museums, offices, or
  anywhere art is displayed. At some subconscious level, people must be so
  sensitive to the value of negative space that they are willing to do work to
  preserve negative space in their own surroundings.
</p>
<p>
  The defense of the negative space in a user experience, however, is a
  never-ending battle. New proposals to “fill that space in” with a new feature,
  ad, or other element arise on a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis. Defense of
  the open space is wearisome but necessary. Once that’s space is gone, it’s
  usually gone forever.
