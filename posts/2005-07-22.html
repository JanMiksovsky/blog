  I just got a new Mac for the first time in ages. I was a complete Mac fanatic
  at the dawn of the Macintosh age, but eventually moved over to Windows since
  that's where the action was. I've taken a look at OS/X numerous times, but
  playing around with a product for a short while isn't the same thing as
  sitting down and really trying to use it to get something done.
</p>
<p>
  I'm constantly struck by how little effort OS/X Tiger expends in bothering to
  explain the purpose of controls. Most of the bundled apps include their own
  collection of beautifully rendered little widgets whose purpose is often
  difficult to discern. My favorite example is the little glass bead found in
  the upper right corner of numerous windows for expanding and collapsing the
  toolbar and sidebar:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    src="/images/flowstate/mac_osx_glass_bead.png"
    title="Mac_osx_glass_bead"
    alt="Mac_osx_glass_bead"
  />
</p>
<p>
  The glass bead in the upper right corner surely represents some sort of high
  water mark for obscurity. No text or icon to detract from the purity of the
  lovingly rendered glass! Maybe hovering the mouse over it produces a little
  tip window? Nope. (Why the heck not?) The search box, at least, uses a
  magnifying glass icon to suggest its purpose, even if the icon is highly
  abstract in both visual representation and concept. It's hard to think of a
  control that communicates less about its purpose than this little glass bead.
  (But not impossible -- perhaps we should be grateful the bead is at least
  adjacent to the region of the window it affects.)
</p>
<p>
  The new user looks at the control and wonders, &quot;What the hell do
  <em>you</em> do?&quot;<br />The control gives its stony reply: &quot;If you
  must ask, you are unworthy.&quot;<br />
</p>
