  I&#39;ve been considering putting together a video screencast sharing some
  thoughts on web UI components, covering the case for why we need them, some
  limited solutions today, the prospects for the Web Components standard, and
  the principles behind my own work on the
  <a href="https://quickui.org">QuickUI</a> web component framework. It&#39;s
  been my experiencing that producing even a very short video takes gobs of
  time, but it occurred to me that I could break up the talk into short
  segments, perhaps 5 minutes or less in length. As an experiment, I created
  this short (4 minute) intro video:

  WheneverI speak in group settings, I always find myself sketching ideas on the
  whiteboard, so I thought that a whiteboard talk might be a reasonable format
  for a web video â€“ perhaps that can strike a good balance between something
  that&#39;s engaging while also not incredibly time-consuming to produce. In
  the course of considering how to make such a whiteboard talk, I came across an
  interesting iPad app called <a href="https://doceri.com/">Doceri</a> that lets
  you project your iPad sketches onto a desktop computer. Doceri includes its
  own complete screencast production tool, but unfortunately the audio quality
  of an iPad&#39;s built-in mic isn&#39;t great, and editing on an iPad is
  currently cumbersome. I ended up projecting the Doceri project onto a desktop
  window, capturing the window contents with Camtasia, then laying down the
  audio narration in Camtasia and doing final editing there.

  I hope you find this short video interesting. If this seems worthwhile, I
  might follow up with additional segments on a semi-regular schedule.
