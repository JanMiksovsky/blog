<p>
  The <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</a> has been updated
  to version 0.9.3.1. This is a modest update in terms of functionality, but a
  significant milestone for the catalog — it represents the culmination of an
  effort to port all the Catalog controls to a combination of CoffeeScript and
  LESS.
</p>
<p>
  The original QuickUI framework included the use of a local build tool called
  the QuickUI markup compiler. This compiled a markup format that was
  essentially HTML plus the use of custom tags. (In this, the format was
  remarkably similar to the spec'ed format for Web Components.) Because this
  format never got any traction, it was eventually deprecated, although still
  used for the vast majority of the Catalog controls. 2013 has begun with a
  major push to port all these controls to CoffeeScript for content and behavior
  and LESS for appearance.
</p>
<p>
  Now that that port has been accomplished, it will be easier to move the
  Catalog forward, including the addition of new controls and some refactoring
  of existing ones. Along with this port, a handful of other controls were added
  to the Catalog:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/ToggleButton">ToggleButton</a> is a
    button that can track a selected state. This can be used as is, or as a base
    class for custom toggle classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/Link">Link</a> wraps a standard HTML
    &lt;a&gt; tag, and can be used as a base class for custom link classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://quickui.org/catalog/TextBox">TextBox</a> wraps a standard
    HTML text input element, and can be used as a base class for custom text box
    classes.
  </li>
</ul>
