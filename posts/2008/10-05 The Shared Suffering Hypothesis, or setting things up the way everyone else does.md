  Tinkering endlessly with computer hardware and software can be fun... if you
  have the time. As for me, I eventually came to the paradoxical conclusion that
  the more I tuned a product to my specific needs, the less likely the product
  would actually work as intended—and the less likely I could find someone to
  help me when a problem did arise. Product manufacturers often tout the ability
  of their products to be configured to a user's idiosyncratic needs, but maybe
  users can most effectively minimize heartache this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >The Shared Suffering Hypothesis: You're best off configuring a product so
      as to maximize the number of other people who can help identify and
      resolve problems with that configuration.</em
    >
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Here's an example: A number of years ago I set up a media PC, eschewing the
  small number of commercial media PCs then available to get a tricked-out gamer
  PC. I maxxed every spec—video card, hard drive, etc.—and for its day, this
  machine <em>rocked</em>. What didn't occur to me was that, with each component
  I picked, I was reducing the number of other people who had the same device I
  had. And upon receiving the box, I wiped it and installed an early beta of an
  obscure OS version. Fantastic! Now I had a blazingly fast PC, the likes of
  which were possessed by no one else on the planet!
</p>
<p>
  I was a user community of one. When sorting through the inevitable driver
  weirdness and other nightmares, I had no one to turn to for help, because no
  one else shared this configuration or anything like it. The OEM and its
  component manufacturers, of course, had no experience with that OS, nor had
  the OS manufacturer ever tested on any of that hardware. The nascent media PC
  user community couldn't help either. This left me solving every configuration
  issue on my own. I spent hours on exciting tasks like trying to see if the PC
  motherboard would cope better with the hard drive configured for RAID 0 or
  RAID 1, or maybe I should try RAID 5? Damn, and all I wanted to do was watch
  TV on this thing.
</p>
<p>
  Lesson learned, when I bought a new media PC a couple years later, I abandoned
  impressive computer specs in favor of amassing the largest number of people
  who could share my problems. If I ran into a problem, I wanted a hundred other
  people to have already hit it and collectively solved it. I purchased a basic
  media PC from a huge OEM—not because they made great media PCs, but because
  they sold a lot of them. I purchased the most vanilla configuration possible,
  more or less blindly accepting the OEM's self-serving default hardware
  recommendations. The more defaults I could accept, the more likely it was
  someone else would have something like the same box I did. When the box
  arrived, I tried hard to avoid changing anything from the default config, and
  in generally avoided installing funky apps on the box. In the end, the new PC
  wasn't a perfect media experience—but it worked, and I spent very little time
  keeping it that way.
</p>
<p>
  (And now the impending forced cutover to digital cable in the U.S. is going to
  kill me. It's forcing me to rebuild a perfectly good media PC setup, all so
  that our seldom-watched analog cable TV can now be a seldom-watched digital
  cable TV. Once again I'll be searching for the solution that involves the
  least weird configuration.)

  The problem here are the economics of configuration. You'd think you'd benefit
  by tailing a product to your needs, but I believe in most cases that benefit
  is overwhelmed by the benefits of <em>not</em> customizing. And the issue has
  implications for software designers: each time you add an option to your
  product, you might be making things worse for your users, not better. I'll
  take a cut at that question in the next post.
