title: "Transient controls: a delicate balance between discoverability and visual clutter"

  Last week Cozi posted an update to our
  <a href="http://www.cozi.com/products/familycalendar.aspx">family calendar</a>
  that included a small but significant usability fix to the UI for entering
  appointments. In addition to a traditional form-based UI for entering
  appointments, the bottom of the main calendar page offers a text box in which
  a user can type an appointment in English:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  In general this UI for entering appointments works well, but usability testing
  had indicated that a sizable population of users would hesitate when entering
  an appointment. They would type the text of the appointment, then move their
  mouse over the right end of the text box, apparently searching for a button
  they could click to save the appointment.
</p>
<p>
  These users were likely conditioned by web browsers, which generally have a Go
  button to the right of the address field. Advanced users generally don't click
  the Go button (and may take steps to hide it), but many users navigate with
  it. We had originally left off a Go button in the interests of reducing visual
  clutter, and expected people would be able to figure out they could just press
  the ENTER key to save the appointment.
</p>
<p>
  In testing, it became apparent that we were correct, but only to a point. Most
  users would, in fact, eventually try pressing the ENTER key. The issue is that
  it would take a second or two of uncertainty before they would figure it out.
  We didn't like the thought of producing any uncertainty or anxiety, especially
  in relation to the natural-language appointment feature. That's a star feature
  in our calendar, and we want to show off. (Yes, Google Calendar and others
  have a similar feature, but we think ours is better.)
</p>
<p>
  We were reluctant to add a permanent button to the page if we could avoid it.
  Instead, we opted to follow the lead of Internet Explorer and Firefox and use
  a <em>transient control</em>: a control that's only visible part of the time.
  Both IE and Firefox used to have their Go buttons visible all the time, but
  both changed the Go buttons to a transient control that is only visible when
  the user is actually typing a URL.
</p>
<p>
  Here's how it works in Cozi's case. When the user enters the page, the focus
  is in the appointment entry text box. The text box sports hint text to let the
  user know what the text box is for. (Significantly, the hint text does
  <em>not</em> disappear when the text box has the keyboard focusâ€”since the text
  box has the focus by default, hiding the hint text on focus for this field
  would mean the hint text was invisible when it would have been most valuable.
  If the user clicks on the text box, we do hide the hint text, so the user
  doesn't waste any time trying to delete the hint text before typing their own
  text.)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  When the user starts typing, the transient Enter button appears on the far
  right:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/Entry%20Area%202_thumb.png" />
</p>
<p>
  When the user moves the mouse (not shown below) over the Enter button, the
  Enter button exhibits its hover state:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/Entry%20Area%203_thumb.png" />
</p>
<p>
  The user presses the button or types the ENTER key, and the appointment data
  is sent to the server to be parsed. During this round-trip to the server, the
  text box and its associated change to a quasi-disabled state to suggest that:
  a) something is happening, and b) the user shouldn't type again until the text
  box has left this state.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/Entry%20Area%204_thumb.png" />
</p>
<p>
  When the updated calendar data returns from the server, the calendar view
  updates to show the new appointment. The appointment entry text box resets to
  its original state to let the user know they can type again:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/Entry%20Area%201_thumb_1.png" />
</p>
<p>
  So far, this transient Enter button seems to work well, but we will continue
  to watch that button closely in testing. We're cautious about employing this
  UI technique, because it's easy to accidentally sacrifice discoverability in
  the name of visual cleanliness. Here the transient control works well because
  it manages to appear just when a user is about to start looking for it. In
  other cases, a user might hold their mouse still while looking around the
  page, and if they didn't see the control they were expecting, they might jump
  to the reasonable conclusion that such a control did not exist.
