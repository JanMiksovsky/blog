<p>
  I find myself faced with the question of whether to accept animated ads in an
  ad-based product. An animated ad likely detracts from the user's
  experience—everyone says they dislike them—but to what degree? I'm finding it
  difficult to find persuasive research quantifying that effect.
</p>
<p>
  It's relatively easy to find data on the side of the advertiser or the site
  showing the ad. An animated ad will likely be noticed by more people, and can
  have higher click-through rates, which is what an advertiser is looking for.
  Accordingly, a site willing to show an animated ad can charge a higher premium
  for such an ad over a static ad. Animated ads = more revenue. It's hard to
  argue with that—especially at an ad-funded startup.
</p>
<p>
  To put the potential revenue upside in perspective, I'm looking for concrete
  research on the impact of animated ads on the user experience. Here's the kind
  of research that would be most helpful:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Hard data. An anecdotal personal claim that, &quot;I refuse to use a site
    that shows an animated ad&quot;, holds little weight. Same goes for
    claiming, &quot;Everyone hates animated ads... obviously!&quot; If everyone
    hates animated ads, then it should be easy to find research proving that
    point.
  </li>

  <li>
    Focused on the actual effect on site usage. The little research I can find
    seems focused on user opinions. (<a
      href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20041206.html"
      >Example</a
    >, from Jakob Nielsen's AlertBox) I don't want to know whether people like
    animated ads—I want to know how much they actually impair site usage, or
    diminish a site's brand, or drive people away.
  </li>

  <li>
    Recent. I can't use a study done way back in the halcyon days of 1997 when
    the web was fresh and new and people didn't think there should be ads in it
    anywhere.
  </li>

  <li>
    Expressed in money terms. It'd be helpful to find, for example, a case study
    comparing a site's gain in ad revenue from the introduction of animated ads
    with the monetary downsides (if there are any) of those same ads.
  </li>

  <li>
    Objective. A tiny study done by a user interface designer with a personal
    bias may not help. A large study done by a company that's taking the long
    view, and trying to balance revenue with customer satisfaction would be
    better. A peer-reviewed scholarly paper on the topic would be ideal.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Any timely pointers here would be helpful in making this decision. Thanks.

    >posted links to a pair of relevant papers. Those papers were very helpful
    to us in deciding whether to accept animated advertisements. We ultimately
    did decide to accept animated ads, but did put in place some guidelines that
    we hope will keep out the more egregious uses of that medium.</em
