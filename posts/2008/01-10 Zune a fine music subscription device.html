<p>
  Last month I received a Microsoft Zune 80 as a gift. (Thanks, Johnny!) Having
  used the device for several weeks now, I wrote up some opinions of that
  experience to send to a friend on the Zune team, and have decided to share
  those thoughts here as well.
</p>
<p>
  My experience with Zune actually goes back a few months, to when I first
  subscribed to the Zune music service without actually owning a Zune device.
  I'm partial to having a <strong>music subscription</strong> rather than
  &quot;owning&quot; tracks. This is due to personal past experiences wrestling
  with DRM, and the sense of freedom I find in paying a flat fee for unlimited
  music. For $15/month I can listen to whatever I want within the reasonably
  spacious Zune Marketplace. In practice I could use the same amount to buy a
  big pile of audio tracks from iTunes, but for me a subscription enables a
  freer sense of experimentation. Case in point: a relative who visited over the
  holidays wanted to share music by an obscure Chilean musician. It felt great
  to listen to several esoteric albums through the subscription, and there's
  simply no way I would have felt good forking over money on the spot to listen
  to something I might never listen to again.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, owning a Zune in an iPod world feels akin to belonging to an
  oppressed religious minority. Discussions about the Zune with fellow Zune
  owners must be conducted in secret, lest the conversation be overheard by the
  dogmatic iPod-wielding masses. This is too bad, since I found the
  second-generation Zune client software and the Zune device itself to work
  quite well in practice.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  The Zune client on Windows generally looks attractive. The client UI is
  designed carefully enough to reward a close look:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I found it trivial to find new music, download it, and sync it to the Zune.
    YMMV.
  </li>
  <li>
    The original Zune client felt like a warmed-over skin for Windows Media
    Player, while the new one feels distinct enough to have its own style. The
    swirly background fractal may not be to your taste, but at least it's making
    a statement. I like it.
  </li>
  <li>
    A very subtle visual orange/pink gradient animates in the background at the
    bottom of the window when music is playing. I didn't notice this until I
    tried to take screenshots for the image above and compared them. It's
    similar to, but much more subdued than, the background effect in Windows
    Media Center. I assume the effect is there to confer a (slight) sense of
    movement.
  </li>
  <li>
    The UI makes extensive use of elements that come alive or reveal more detail
    on hover, such as scroll bars, the volume label, the device/disc/playlist
    icons in the lower left.
  </li>
  <li>
    The five-star rating system from Media Player always seemed to be more
    detail than I cared to supply. The Zune client replaces this with three
    simple states: neutral, I Like It, or I Don't Like It.
  </li>
  <li>
    The client makes good use of web-style navigation, a style I've referred to
    as a
    <a
      href="/posts/2005/10-14-bbop-the-ubiquitous-yet-under-examined-ui-model.html"
      >BBOP</a
    >
    UI (Buttons, Back, One task, Page-based). My only complaint is that the
    little back arrow in the upper left disappears in the Settings area, which
    is treated like a giant modal dialog. I think that's a mistake—if you're
    going to offer web-style UI with a Back button, you really <em>have</em> to
    offer the Back button on every page, or you're really going to confuse the
    user. I can sympathize with the designers' dilemma, though. It's hard for
    client software designers to accept the fact that a user might want to walk
    away a page in which data has been entered—without making an explicit
    command to save their changes or cancel the operation. People do this every
    day on the web without issue. The Settings area should offer a Back button,
    and if the user happens to click it and loses it, so be it. That's how
    virtually all web pages already work.
  </li>
  <li>
    I was happy to discover that I could sync recorded TV shows from my Windows
    Media Center to the Zune. This worked well overall, even if video files did
    have to go through a slow conversion process. One annoyance was that the
    Videos view on the Zune client only shows the episode title, not the show
    title, air time, or episode description. This makes it hard to find the show
    you want to sync. I assume that essentially no time has been spent designing
    Zune and Media Center to coexist happily, and that minor issues like this
    will get resolved as Media Center integration improves in the future.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm no hardware guru, but the Zune device itself seems well designed.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/flowstate/Zune%20Device.png" />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The out-of-box experience was reasonable.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>The Zune 80 device itself is attractive and lightweight.</li>

  <li>
    The headphones seem better than most. My only complaint is that, like most
    headphones, you can't tell the Left and Right phones apart without looking
    closely at them to find a tiny &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot;. It would be
    great if one could feel which one was which through some means (a raised
    letter, dots, whatever). Interestingly, the Zune cable already does
    something similar: there's a raised bump on one side of the connector so you
    can tell which of the otherwise identical flat surfaces on the connector
    needs to be facing up as you plug it in.&nbsp;
  </li>

  <li>
    Just once I wish I could buy a device with an expensive screen that came
    with its own cheap plastic stick-on screen protector in the box, instead of
    having to hunt for an aftermarket screen protector myself.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The software on the Zune device also looks and feel pretty good.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The touchpad is an elegant way to scroll up and down through lists—while
    allowing you to navigate laterally across lists to the left or right.
  </li>

  <li>The UI uses animated transitions to good effect.</li>

  <li>
    I wish the Zune device UI weren't <em>quite</em> so minimalist. It feels
    like Microsoft is trying to out-minimize Apple by pursuing
    <a href="/posts/2005/07-22-the-inscrutable-purpose-of-mac-controls.html"
      >Apple's desire for a UI that's clean to the point of inscrutability</a
    >. Case in point: I couldn't find the UI for turning on Shuffle. Through
    trial and error I discovered that pressing the middle of the touchpad
    brought up a context menu of sorts which included the Shuffle command. If
    hardware buttons must be context sensitive to keep down the number of
    buttons, I always appreciate an on-screen indication of what they're going
    to do if I press them now. Windows Mobile does a decent job of this by
    always showing what the two soft buttons directly below the screen will do.
  </li>

  <li>
    I'm really curious about the decision to have the main menu scroll. In the
    above image, you can see that the designers have very carefully sized and
    positioned the menu items so that one item (&quot;podcasts&quot;) is clipped
    at the bottom of the screen. This is a great way to indicate that the user
    can scroll down to see more items without having to resort to a heavy-handed
    scroll bar. Very elegantly done, yes? So, how many additional menu items do
    you think you will gain access to if you scroll down? <em>One</em>. One! If
    you scroll down, you'll see one more item (&quot;settings&quot;). I'd be
    inclined to dismiss this as insanity, if it weren't for the careful
    attention to detail here. It would have been trivial to position and size
    the text slightly differently to get all the text to fit on the screen
    without scrolling. More to the point, it would have a been a
    <em>lot</em> easier to develop. I can only conclude that making the menu
    feel more dynamic (by forcing the user to scroll) felt better than offering
    a completely static menu.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Photos area was fine, but I was disappointed the device doesn't include
    a rotation sensor like the iPhone (or most modern digital cameras). This
    means that, when looking at photos, valuable screen real estate is often
    wasted, and pictures are shown at a size smaller than that of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Zune offers a modest personalization option: you can set the background
    of the main menu to a photo. Surprisingly, that was entirely sufficient for
    me to feel like I'd made the device mine. Many other devices do this, of
    course, but here the trick felt a particularly effective because the main
    menu itself is so minimal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In putting the device through its paces, I ran into more than a few issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Zune client incorrectly catalogued a few albums under the wrong artist.
    This appears to be a
    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=945319">bug</a> introduced during
    the upgrade from Zune 1.x to Zune 2.0.
  </li>

  <li>
    I was puzzled why the Zune client doesn't offer a context menu on every UI
    element a user might conceivably want to right-click on. There are no
    context menus on many online store data elements, for example. A UI that
    makes inconsistent use of context menus can be pretty frustrating, here all
    the more so because context menus are a nearly perfect way to offer a rich
    set of commands without cluttering the UI.
  </li>

  <li>
    I'd prefer a Now Playing area in the client that showed what was playing
    without a distracting album art visualization.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Zune Marketplace often appears to get confused as to which online tracks
    are already in my collection.
  </li>

  <li>
    The client frequently hiccups when I move between PCs. One of the major
    benefits of a music subscription is being able to move from one PC to
    another and not have to go through the absurd exercise of copying massive
    piles of audio bits everywhere I want to listen to music. The Zune client
    sometimes gets confused if I switch PCs and try to listen to music through
    the subscription. Signing out and back in always fixes the problem, but
    that's an irritating workaround. I'm hoping the client will eventually do a
    better job of automatically signing in whenever one switches to a different
    PC.
  </li>

  <li>
    I had trouble syncing over WiFi: nothing would happen, or else I would see a
    cryptic error message. I eventually discovered that the error message would
    go away if I got closer to the wireless router, so presumably the error
    message was just a (very bad) way of saying the WiFi signal wasn't strong
    enough.
  </li>

  <li>
    The aforementioned Settings area pegs its buttons to the lower right, which
    is a bad idea. On a large monitor, these controls all but disappear in a
    distant corner of the screen, far from the content they pertain to. This
    common UI flub occurs when
    <a
      href="/posts/2005/07-13-a-ui-sketch-whose-controls-perfectly-fill-the-window-is-probably-too-good-to-be-true.html"
      >designers optimize too much for a specific window size</a
    >.
  </li>

  <li>
    While home videos on my local PC show up in the Zune library, videos on a
    networked PC don't show up at all, with no explanation. I still can't figure
    this out.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Zune would make for a decent podcast player—if it weren't for a
    crippling bug: the Zune sometimes (randomly?) forgets what portion of the
    podcast already I've listened to. For me, being able to Resume a paused
    podcast is the feature that distinguishes a music player from a podcast
    player. The unreliability of this feature on the Zune nearly wipes out it's
    value as a podcast player.
  </li>

  <li>
    Both the Podcast and Videos areas are missing a crucial feature: the ability
    to remove a podcast or TV show when you're done listening or watching to it.
    A list of podcasts isn't like a list of songs you want to listen to over and
    over. It's more like a To Do list of things you want to listen to once. It's
    tedious to have to go back to your PC just to remove a podcast you've
    listened to or a TV show you've watched.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, I'm pretty happy with my Zune 80. As a music player for an online
  music subscription service, the Zune works nearly flawlessly. It's less
  effective as a podcast or video player, but I'm looking forward to seeing
  those deficiencies addressed.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure what Microsoft can do about Zune's biggest handicap: its brand.
  People like buying Apple products because of what they feel the purchase says
  about them. At this point, buying a Zune either tells people that you're a
  Microsoft-loving sap, or else so uninformed as to be unaware that you've just
  purchased a second-place music player. Virtually all of this bad vibe is
  attributable to the unshakable feeling that Microsoft is trying too hard to be
  cool. I actually think Microsoft has made some bold and innovative moves in
  designing and marketing the Zune, but all that works has to fight against the
  grain of the intrinsically uncool brand of Microsoft itself. And for what? I
  can't think of a single way in which the Microsoft brand has helped the Zune
  in any way, and one can only wonder how much more successful the Zune would be
  if it had been marketed as a completely independent entity. To their credit,
  the Zune folks at Microsoft are painfully aware of this enormous marketing
  handicap, and I wish them the best of luck overcoming it.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, I'll be happily listening to all the music I can eat on my
  Zune.
