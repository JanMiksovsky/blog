  This past September, I was invited to present a short 20 minute talk on user
  experience design at the StartupDay 2010 conference in Bellevue, WA. This is a
  nice bootcamp event for nascent entrepreneursâ€”a single day touching on every
  aspect of starting a company, from finding cofounders, identifying an
  audience, searching for a business model,&#0160;getting funding, ... all the
  way to potential exits.
</p>
<p>
  Since the vast majority of the audience were engineers and business types
  (i.e., not designers), I focused on the topic: What should user experience
  design at a startup look like to a founder or executive?
