  Most UI platforms allow a designer to indicate which button in a dialog should
  be the <em>default button</em>: the button that will be pressed if the user
  types the Enter key. The default button is generally the button the user is
  most likely to press next, often a button like OK that closes the dialog. In
  very high-traffic dialogs, you may want to consider dynamically changing the
  default button to save keystrokes and help speed the user's task.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The best example I can think of is the &quot;Select Names&quot; dialog in
  Microsoft Outlook for picking recipients for an email message. When the dialog
  opens, the focus starts out the &quot;Type Name&quot; field, and the default
  button is the &quot;To -&gt;&quot; button:

  />
</p>
<p>
  The user can start typing a name immediately, and when they've finished typing
  the name (or have selected a name in the list), they can press Enter to do the
  most likely thing: add the name to the message's To line.
</p>
<p>
  Here's where things get interesting. Watch what happens after the user presses
  Enter:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    width="394"
    border="0"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/outlook_address_book_3.png"

    alt="Outlook_address_book_3"
  />
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  The OK button is now the default button! Having added someone to the To line,
  the user's most likely next action has changed: they're now most likely to
  want to click the OK button and close the dialog. So, the OK button becomes
  the default button. (Leaving the To button as the default would be a bit of a
  waste here, because there's essentially no chance that the user wants to add
  the same recipient to the message twice.)
</p>
<p>
  The keyboard focus stays in the &quot;Type Name&quot; field. (The previous
  name is left selected in case the user wants to edit it, but typing will
  replace the selection.) The user can type any key but Enter (or Escape, etc.)
  to start entering a new name, in which case the &quot;To -&gt;&quot; button
  becomes the default button again. That is, the user is returned to the state
  shown in the first image.
</p>
<p>
  The overall result is that a user can open the dialog, type a name, then press
  Enter twice to add the name and close the dialog. This behavior is natural
  enough that most users zip through the dialog without even noticing what's
  going on.
</p>
<p>
  Since this technique is somewhat unusual, it should be used judiciously. The
  above dialog was arrived at after many, many iterations, and capitalizes on a
  very predictable sequence of user actions to shave time off a very common
  task. Without careful attention to detail, it would be easy to end up moving
  the default button to the wrong place and cause users to accidentally press
  the wrong button. The larger point here is that it's worth exploring the
  limits of standard user interface behavior to streamline a UI that will
  receive a high volume of traffic.
