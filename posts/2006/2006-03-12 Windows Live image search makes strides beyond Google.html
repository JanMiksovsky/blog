  It's a relief to finally see Ajax-based search pages moving beyond the
  limitations of vanilla HTML pages. A good example is the recent update to
  Windows Live
  <a
    href="http://www.live.com/#q=cherry%20blossoms&amp;scope=images&amp;page=results"
    >Image Search</a
  >, which allows you to browse an entire set of search results in a single
  scrolling region.

  I use Google's
  <a
    href="http://images.google.com/images?q=cherry+blossoms&amp;btnG=Search+Images"
    >image search</a
  >
  a lot. The most time-consuming part of posting to this blog is often getting a
  decent screenshot, and while a
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2005/12/elegant_cropper.html"
    >good screen capture tool</a
  >
  is invaluable, it's often faster to google for a screenshot. For certain types
  of UIs, such as cell phone UIs, this is sometimes the only reasonable way to
  get a good screenshot at all.
</p>
<p>
  Google's image search tool is good but doesn't seem to have changed
  significantly in a year or so, whereas Microsoft's image search tool makes a
  number of important advances. Live's single scrolling region is much faster to
  navigate than Google's multiple pages, especially since Google insists on
  putting the Next button only at the bottom of the page (where it often ends up
  below the fold). Live also lets you scale the size of the thumbnails so you
  can either quickly scan lots of images or linger over more detail. Live makes
  good use of large ToolTip pop-ups that give you a decent preview of the image
  before you navigate. Finally, after you click a thumbnail, Live provides a
  filmstrip view of your search context down the left side of the page, allowing
  you to continue navigating without having to return to the main results page.
</p>
<p>
  It must said that even though Live's virtualized image list box is faster in
  practice to navigate than browsing multiple pages, the scroll bar feels just
  slow enough to make the overall user experience seem unresponsive. Hopefully
  they haven't hit the upper bound of what's possible in Ajax yet, and we'll see
  some improvement in performance in Liveâ€”and in Google as they play
  catch-up.<br />
