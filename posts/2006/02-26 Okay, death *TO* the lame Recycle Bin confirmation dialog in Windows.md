title: "Okay, death *TO* the lame Recycle Bin confirmation dialog in Windows"

  Thanks to those of you who pointed out that the first Windows delete
  confirmation dialog described in the previous post only appears when the user
  presses the Del key, but not if they use drag and drop. (I'd been trying to
  reproduce the dialog using drag and drop.)
</p>
<p>
  Both Windows and the Mac offer multi-key keyboard shortcuts (Shift+Del and
  Command+Backspace, respectively) to delete a file without displaying a
  confirmation dialog. Since the Mac doesn't offer a single key shortcut for
  deleting a file, it has no need of a confirmation dialog. Personally, I find
  this to be an elegant answer, although it's inconceivable that Windows would
  take its Del shortcut away.

  I still argue that the dialog in Windows should fade away. As a comment to the
  earlier post describes, the dialog would be an appropriate place to educate
  the user on how the Recycle Bin works, where to find it, and how to get things
  back out of it. Once the user has figured out how the Recycle Bin works, they
  should be able to easily get rid of the dialog with an option in the dialog
  itself (and not in a property dialog far away). Alternatively, Windows could
  simply track user actions and determine when the user no longer required this
  education.
