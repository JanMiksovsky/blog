  The new <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/nuvi/">Garmin Nuvi</a> GPS
  presents a well thought-out UI, cleanly knitting together three modes of
  interaction: display, touch, and audio.

  Garmin and other manufacturers have been making GPS units since the late
  1980s, and during that time have continually made incremental improvements in
  size, form factor, performance, and UI. From time to time I've looked at the
  category, but beyond the flat-out magic of finding your way using satellites,
  I found little captivating about the products themselves. GPS units have
  suffered from a wide range of UI problems, such as the heavy use of jargon,
  awkward use of a few buttons to accomplish complex tasks (such as entering an
  address), and cumbersome systems for transferring maps to a device with
  limited memory.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes you encounter a product and get the strong feeling its the first one
  in its category to really be Designed, with a capital &quot;D&quot;. In my
  case, <a href="http://www.tomtom.com">TomTom</a> had the first GPS with that
  distinction. From the branding to the startup sound to the UI, they had
  clearly thought about the product as a consumer experience. Despite breaking
  that ground, I still felt that the TomTom product I saw came up short.
</p>
<p>
  The Garmin Nuvi is the first GPS I've seen that meets my bar for a good user
  experience. They've given a lot of thought to an overall package of
  functionality a traveler might want in a single pocket device. In addition to
  the GPS, the Nuvi unit includes an MP3 player, a photo vault, a currency
  converter, a world clock, a foreign language dictionary, and a travel guide.
  This is a good sign that Garmin's considering the overall user experience of
  the device, not just trying to make a housing for a satellite receiver.
</p>
<p>
  You can read thorough plenty of reviews of the Nuvi elsewhere, so I'll focus
  on the nice bits in the user experience:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Clear screen organization, with careful use of color, shape, contrast, and
    typography to define a hierarchy of screen elements. Consider that in the
    above image they've made the &quot;200&quot; in a significantly larger font
    than the &quot;m&quot; (meters) unit that follows it. Moreover, they've
    top-aligned the &quot;m&quot; unit to maintain the legibility of the much
    more important number. In this particular application, it's critical for the
    user to be able to glance down at the screen and get a sense of how far they
    have to go until they need to turn. That is, if they see three characters,
    they know they have hundreds (3 characters) of meters left to go, not
    thousands (4 characters). Displaying the units as &quot;200m&quot; in the
    same font and aligned along the text baseline would make it harder for the
    user to intuitively grasp this.
  </li>

  <li>
    Responsive touch screen. Unlike some folks (like
    <a
      href="/posts/2005/09-22-lcds-recreating-old-physical-controls-whether-or-not-that-makes-sense-.html"
      >Toyota</a
    >), Garmin generally makes good use of buttons placed flush against the
    corners to improve the chance you'll actually hit what you want. (The map
    screen above is an exception.)
  </li>

  <li>
    Generally solid implementation of a
    <a
      href="/posts/2005/10-14-bbop-the-ubiquitous-yet-under-examined-ui-model.html"
      >BBOP</a
    >
    (Back, Buttons, One Task, Page Based) UI. One small nit: they show a Back
    button on <em>almost</em> every page, but not on all pages. In particular,
    if you click the Menu button in the main driving map (shown above), you end
    up a menu page with no clear way to get back to what you were looking at. It
    turns out you need to pick one of the menu options: the one called
    &quot;View Map&quot;. I found this counter-intuitive. In general, I think
    that if you're going to offer a Back button on the screen, you need to offer
    this button on every screen and in the same location.
  </li>

  <li>
    Judicious use of &quot;transparent&quot; buttons on maps to add UI elements
    that take up a surprisingly small amount of actual screen pixels. The Zoom
    In/Out buttons shown above are roughly 46x46 pixels square and the border is
    two pixels thick. The borders only consume about 350 pixels, and for that
    price they get a pretty big transparent button. A transparent button like
    this consumes about the same number of pixels as a 19x19 solid button, which
    would be incredibly tiny on a touch screen.
  </li>

  <li>
    Reasonably good voice prompts with text-to-speech. I was impressed with the
    Nuvi's ability to not only pronounce local street names, but to apply fairly
    natural phrasing and intonation to an entire instruction. I do think Nuvi
    and similar products could benefit by tightening up the phrases they're
    trying to read. No human passenger includes street type or direction markers
    when giving instructions to a driver, unless such information is currently
    salient. Instead of saying, &quot;Turn left of East Galer Street&quot; like
    the Nuvi does, people say, &quot;Turn left on Galer&quot;. People generally
    add more information like &quot;East&quot; only when that helps discriminate
    among the current roads the driver can turn down. It would be relatively
    trivial to add this refinement to a GPS voice UI.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, a nice information appliance.</p>
