  One of the realities of startup life is that there's not much time left for
  side pursuits like blogging. Every project ebbs and flows between periods that
  are busy and periods that are completely, insanely busy. The last two months
  have qualified as insanely busy, forcing an unplanned hiatus from blogging
  here on flow|state.

  Many thanks to those of you who shared their support and quietly expressed
  interest in when the next post was coming. As my company's first product
  trundles along towards its initial launch, there will be more insanely busy
  periods, but I'm hoping to find a posting schedule that lets me keep
  contributing even through those periods.
