<p>Consider the following hypothetical computer experience:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >One day a friend of yours sends you a one line email saying, &quot;Hey,
      check out FooBar!&quot; That's all the message says. &quot;Okay&quot;,
      you're wondering, &quot;What the heck is FooBar?&quot; You follow the link
      to the FooBar site, and all you can see is a EULA check box and a
      &quot;Sign Up&quot; button. You have no idea what FooBar does, so you're
      reluctant to entrust any information to this site. Before leaving, you
      notice a tiny link that says, &quot;Learn more about FooBar&quot;. You
      click it, and are presented with the FooBar logo and a short paragraph
      that says that FooBar is pretty cool. You're still confused about what it
      does because you can't actually get inside and see it for yourself.
      Finally, overcome with curiosity about why your friend would recommend the
      site, you give in and click the Sign Up button.</em
    >&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    <em
      >Once inside the site, you realize the site is stupid, and wish you'd
      never signed up. You later discover that all your friends have just
      received a one line email from you saying &quot;Hey, check out
      FooBar!&quot;</em
    >
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This, in a nutshell, seems to be the experience of trying the typical
  <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> app. Granted, in Facebook, the
  above experience would generally take place entirely within the world of
  Facebook (with its own messaging system, etc.), but I think the story captures
  the basic pointless mystery of it all.
</p>
<p>
  I've been watching with interest how Facebook's application model will pan
  out, particularly the user experience of engaging with an application:
  discovering it, learning about it, adding it to one's profile, and using it. A
  while back I noted how many companies were busily removing
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2007/05/hurdles_in_the_.html"
    >hurdles at a site's entrance</a
  >
  so people could experience a product's value (or at least a taste of the
  product's value) before committing to the product. Facebook, in contrast,
  seems to be confidently bucking this trend with the apps that live on top of
  its platform.
</p>
<p>
  On the one hand, Facebook users can quickly add a new app to their profile
  because they don't have to reenter personal information for each app. However,
  in my opinion, this advantage is overwhelmed by the
  <em>de facto</em> requirement that a user add a Facebook app to their profile
  before they can derive any meaningful value from it—or even understand what it
  does.
</p>
<p>
  The first point of contact you may have with an app may be when it tries to
  catch your attention in your feed:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    width="461"
    height="73"
    border="0"
    alt="Facebook News Feed - Friend Added Application"
    src="/images/flowstate/Facebook%20News%20Feed%20-%20Friend%20Added%20Application.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Many apps are deliberately coy about what they do before you install them.
  Many (or sometimes all) of the links in the feed entry will require that you
  first add the app to your profile:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    width="649"
    height="410"
    border="0"
    alt="Facebook Add Super Wall"
    src="/images/flowstate/Facebook%20Add%20Super%20Wall_thumb.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  If the anecdotal accounts of my friends are anything to go by, at this point
  most people just go ahead and click the big Add button. A curious user can
  read the laconic and non-descriptive Developer's Description. An especially
  cautious user can click the tiny &quot;More information about
  &lt;application&gt;&quot; link to view an About page:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/WindowsLiveWriter/Facebook%20Super%20Wall%20(Full).png"
    ><img
      width="248"
      height="480"
      border="0"
      alt="Facebook About Super Wall"
      src="/images/flowstate/Facebook%20Super%20Wall%20(Full)_thumb.png"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>
  If you do add the application, unless you're careful to uncheck &quot;Publish
  stories in my News Feed and Mini-Feed&quot;, you'll end up telling all your
  friends that you've just added the app to your profile (in the manner of the
  original news feed entry shown above). The app has enlisted your unwitting
  help in perpetuating its pointless mystery.
</p>
<p>
  That mystery would, in fact, seem to be the basis for the viral distribution
  model of many Facebook apps. I have trouble with this approach, being founded
  on a disregard for a user's intelligence and precious time.This model relies
  entirely on mystery to entice you add the application—and then banks on the
  fact that, once you add an application to your profile, you'll just leave it
  there rather than remove it. This is fundamentally deceptive.
</p>
<p>
  (The deception is compounded in cases like the one above, in which the app
  developer has deliberately incorporated a <em>huge </em>amount of white space
  into their description. Below the app's description, Facebook displays
  commentary from friends and other users of the app about the app itself. The
  obvious purpose of incorporating lots of white space into the description is
  to push all the commentary far below the fold, the better to leave the app's
  potential users uninformed.)
</p>
<p>
  That a Facebook app would hide information about itself suggests the app
  offers no persistent, real value. If it were actually valuable, the app would
  employ all the means at the disposal of a normal web site to balance the
  amount of value they provide to user with the degree of commitment they
  require from the user. For example, a normal site might let a curious
  potential customer: start a process but not finish it; read content but not
  write content; do something a fixed number of times; use the site for a trial
  period; perform certain basic operations but not other, more interesting ones;
  etc. Even the most brain-dead web site at least presents information about
  itself <em>first</em>, before making you sign up for the site. The first
  generation of Facebook apps generally forego all these techniques in favor of
  an all-or-nothing requirement that you add the app to your profile.
</p>
<p>
  Remove a Facebook app you don't like is not hard, requiring a simple click on
  the little &quot;X&quot; in the app's profile box. Still, it's a tiny bit of
  work, and the work adds up with every app you try. I have to believe that most
  people will eventually tire of removing applications, and therefore tire of
  adding them. That in turn means the Facebook world is biased in favor of the
  first set of Facebook apps a user comes into contact with (i.e., all the apps
  used by their initial Facebook friends), and impairs the ability of later apps
  to succeed.
</p>
<p>
  One could argue that it's in the interests of Facebook and an app's developer
  to force a user to agree to an app's terms of use before they can use it. And
  yet somehow the rest of the Internet doesn't have this problem. In the normal
  web, users implicitly agree to a &quot;browse wrap&quot; agreement whenever
  they visit the site, conferring a degree of legal protection to the site.
  Presumably this same level of protection extends to browsing Facebook apps, so
  it's unclear why Facebook would be more concerned about this than sites on the
  open web.
</p>
<p>
  I also find it hard to stomach the presumption that, when you add an app on
  Facebook, by default the platform and app presume to advertise that the app is
  now part of your identity. That's absurd.
  <em>You haven't even seen what the app does.</em> What else in the world works
  this way? When you pick up a book in a bookstore to <em>consider</em> buying
  it, are you really prepared to declare to everyone you know that you've picked
  up the book? The news feed entries about adding applications seem like nothing
  more than spam. They do, however, also also serve Facebook's ulterior goal of
  giving every user the illusion of social activity, regardless of how many
  friends they have or how active those friends are.
</p>
<p>
  All the behavior described here appears to stem from a combination of
  deliberate platform limitations, unintentional platform limitations,
  <em>de facto</em> conventions that arose around the plaform's first apps, and
  plain bad design. A newer generation of apps do let you see a tiny bit of
  their functionality before you the add the application to your profile, but
  what you can see is generally still a very limited subset of what the app
  does.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of their intent, it's fascinating to see Facebook facilitate such a
  closed app adoption model—and still create a successful and vibrant
  application platform. Clearly there are a huge number of people who don't mind
  (yet) adding unknown applications to their profile, nor do they mind (yet)
  advertising that fact to the world. What's odd is that those same users don't
  tolerate the same experience on every other web site. I'm hopeful those users
  will eventually turn away from Facebook's unnecessarily mysterious apps, and
  eventually force those apps to open their front doors as wide as the rest of
  the web.
