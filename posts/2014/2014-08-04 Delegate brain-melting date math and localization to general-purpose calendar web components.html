<p>Which of these month calendars looks correct to you?</p>

  One of the calendars will probably look right. The other two will just look
  wrong — like they’re mistakes, or maybe not even calendars. Setting aside the
  basics of which language the words appear in, the simple question of which day
  column should be first is a pretty key thing to get right in a calendar.
  Depending on where you live or grew up, you may prefer that the first column
  of a month calendar be Mondays, Sundays, or Saturdays. (It’s not completely
  clear to me, but it appears there may be a community of people — speakers of
  Dari, a dialect of Persian — who prefer that the first column be Fridays.) In
  some languages, you may want the order of days to go right-to-left as well, in
  which case you might want the first column to be the rightmost instead of the
  leftmost.
</p>
<p>
  These are the kinds of detail that are nearly impossible for a small team to
  get right if they’re writing their own calendar from scratch, and yet the
  world is filled with proprietary date picker widgets and calendars. Even if we
  ignore the colossal waste of time represented by all those unnecessary
  reinventions of the calendar, nearly all of those calendar implementations
  will fail to localize basic details (such as the day shown as the first day of
  the week). That is, if your app is using a calendar your team wrote from
  scratch, there is a very good chance that a substantial number of users
  outside your country and language view believe your calendar is just wrong.
  And even if you picked up a calendar widget at some point, and it was pretty
  good to begin with, if you copied that code, you likely haven&#39;t picked up
  any of the bug fixes that were made in it since you made your copy.
</p>
<p>
  This is yet another area where a broad web component ecosystem will
  fundamentally change things. As discussed on this blog many times before, the
  economics of user experience design and engineering will of course change. But
  it’s also the case that sharing solid user interface components will finally
  allow a broad swath of the software industry to finally get UI details right
  on tricky things like calendars.
</p>
<h2>Open calendar components</h2>
<p>
  With that goal in mind, I’ve contributed a set of calendar components to the
  open source Basic Web Components project. Rather than producing a monolithic
  monthly calendar component, these components follow the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/basic-web-components/components-dev/wiki/Ten-Principles-for-Great-General-Purpose-Web-Components"
    target="_self"
    >guidelines for general-purpose components</a
  >. Among other things, they are factored into components that each try to do
  just a single thing well:&#0160;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-calendar-day"
        target="_self"
        >basic-calendar-day</a
      >. This shows a single day in a week/month/year calendar. It has a date
      attribute indicating which day to show. By default, it just shows the
      number of that day in the month. That is, for August 1, 2014, it just
      shows the text “1”. That’s all it does.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-calendar-week"
        target="_self"
        >basic-calendar-week</a
      >. This represents a single week. It’s just a collection of 7
      basic-calendar-day components whose date attributes are synced to always
      be one day apart. (The component takes special care to deal with things
      like daylight savings time changes.) Which day of the week is shown first
      can be changed to suit the user’s preferred location/culture (see
      localization, below). By default, the days are shown in a horizontal
      layout. This week is used in the month calendar component described below,
      but could also also be used in other situations, such as an
      infinitely-scrollable calendar.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-calendar-month-days"
        target="_self"
        >basic-calendar-month-days</a
      >. This shows the days of a single calendar month. This is constructed as
      set of 4 to 6 instances of basic-calendar-week. (The number varies based
      on the length of the month and the day of the week the month starts on.)
      This component does not include any headings. By default, weeks are shown
      in a vertical stack. This is done with default styling using a CSS
      display: table-row-group rule, so that headings for the day columns can
      easily be added and lined up correctly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-days-of-week"
        target="_self"
        >basic-days-of-week</a
      >. This just shows the names for the days of the week in a given language
      (see localization, below). The standard CSS styling for this has display:
      table-row-group, so it can easily be matched up with a table-row or
      table-row-group like basic-calendar-month-days. This component (and some
      of the others here) doesn’t have the word “calendar” in its component name
      because there might be some situations in which its useful outside the
      context of a standard monthly calendar. It could serve, say, as a header
      for a table showing weekly specials in a restaurant, or a chore chart of
      kids, etc.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-month-name"
        target="_self"
        >basic-month-name</a
      >. This shows the name of the month in a given language (see localization,
      below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-month-and-year"
        target="_self"
        >basic-month-and-year</a
      >. This shows the name of the month and the year for a given date. The
      order of the month name and year will match the direction of the text in a
      right-to-left language like Arabic or Hebrew.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-calendar-month"
        target="_self"
        >basic-calendar-month</a
      >. This component puts together the above elements in a typical layout for
      a month calendar. It stacks together headings for basic-month-and-year and
      basic-days-of-week on top of a table of days provided by
      basic-calendar-month-days. Setting the desired language/culture for this
      component updates all the headings as well as the day shown as the first
      day of the week.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that basic-calendar-month just renders a calendar. It doesn’t handle date
  selection, although that could be added through creation of another component.
  The month calendar is inline (directly on the page), but could be incorporated
  into a dropdown for a typical dropdown date picker. Or you could combine
  twelve instances of basic-calendar-month together to create a year calendar,
  etc., etc.
</p>
<p>
  Per the guidelines, these components include an absolutely minimal degree of
  styling required to get something useful. You would undoubtedly want to style
  these further to meet your own application’s brand. This should not be too
  difficult, as web components can be styled through CSS.
</p>
<h2>Localization</h2>
<p>
  To easily and accurately localize these calendar web components, they all make
  use of the excellent
  <a href="https://github.com/jquery/globalize" target="_self">Globalize</a>
  project sponsored by jQuery. Globalize supports about 350 different languages,
  locations, and cultures around the world. As it turns out, Globalize already
  defines everything these components need: which day of the week should come
  first, the names of the days, and the names of the months. So you can simply
  tell Globalize to load the settings for a particular language/culture, and
  then hand that pile of settings to the components, and they’ll set themselves
  up appropriately. Here’s basic-month-calendar in Japanese, French (in France),
  and Arabic (in Saudi Arabia):
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Calendar (Japanese)"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201a3fd3db373970b-800wi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Calendar (French)"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201a73df8be84970d-800wi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Calendar (Arabic, Saudi Arabia)"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201a3fd3db388970b-800wi.png"
  />&#0160;
</p>
<p>
  Note that all text strings here (the month names, and the names for the days
  of the week) are coming from Globalize, not from the application or the
  calendar component. Globalize also supports different formats for the names of
  the days of the week, so you can choose between&#0160;full and abbreviated
  headings.
</p>
<p>
  <em
    >[Aside: an open question for me is whether a calendar for a right-to-left
    language should have the order of days go from right-to-left as well. I can
    find some Arabic calendars, for example, that have the first day of the week
    go in the rightmost column —&#0160;but I can also find plenty of examples
    that have the first day of the week in the leftmost column. And all the
    examples of Hebrew calendars I can find have the first day of the week in
    the leftmost column. This just goes to show that localization will always
    surprise you and/or make your head hurt. The Globalize library doesn’t seem
    to include information on the preferred direction of time, so for now these
    components assume that left-to-right is generally acceptable.]</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  To simplify the localization of an app using these components, I’ve put
  together a simple
  <a
    href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-culture-selector"
    target="_self"
    >basic-culture-selector</a
  >
  component that can dynamically load all the necessary settings based on the
  user’s prefered language/culture. (This component can also be used
  behind-the-scenes as a language/culture settings loader.) Components such as
  these calendar components can then obtain the right settings from an instance
  of basic-culture-selector directly through declarative data binding, with no
  scripting required.
</p>
<p>
  Reality check: Localization is an incredibly complex topic, and language- and
  culture-aware components are just a part of a solution. To really do justice
  to a global audience, an app team would need to take a comprehensive approach
  to localization. Among other things, an app would need some reasonable way to
  set a default language/culture (based on domain, geolocation, and/or apparent
  IP location), a way to store language/culture preferences with a user account,
  and a UI for switching language/culture. It would also help if browser vendors
  participated in a good standard solution, so users aren’t forced to indicate
  their preferred language/country/etc. on a site-by-site basis. Still, having
  solid, localizable components is a good place to start.
</p>
<h2>A calendar as a meta-component</h2>
<p>
  Many applications want to render data on a calendar: appointments,
  availability, and so on. Most calendar widgets are useless in this regard
  outside a narrowly-envisioned range of scenarios, because they make so many
  assumptions about what data will be shown. Rather than viewing a week or month
  calendar as having a particular visual representation, it seems more helpful
  to consider a calendar as a skeleton or abstract structure capable of holding
  components for each day whose only requirement is that they can accept a date.
  How a day component renders that date is entirely up to them.
</p>
<p>
  For this reason, the basic-calendar-month (and -week) components have a dayTag
  attribute that can be used to provide the name of another component class that
  will be used to render the individual days of the month/week. The default
  dayTag value is basic-calendar-day, but this can be changed to any other
  class. The only requirement on the interface of the indicated class is that it
  have a property setter called “date” that accepts a JavaScript Date object.
  This allows one to easily render arbitrary data into the structure of a
  calendar.
</p>
<p>
  To show this in action, suppose we want to create a month calendar that shows
  the major phases of the moon (new, first quarter, full, last quarter, or
  nothing special). To keep things well factored, we start by creating a web
  component called
  <a
    href="https://github.com/basic-web-components/basic-calendar-day/blob/master/demo/moon-phase.html"
    target="_self"
    >moon-phase</a
  >&#0160;that just renders the phase of the moon as an icon. It doesn’t shown a
  day number, or anything else, because we just want it to do one thing really
  well.
</p>
<p>
  We then create a custom day component, either from scratch or, for simplicity,
  by extending the existing basic-calendar-day component. We drop an instance of
  moon-phase into that class and add a day number so we get both the number and
  the moon icon. Finally, we instantiate a basic-month-calendar and tell it to
  use that class to render the days. Et voilà, with a teeny tiny bit of work, we
  get a perpetual moon calendar. In U.S. English, this would look like:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Calendar (Moon Phase)"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201a3fd3db566970b-800wi.png"
  />
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  [See the
  <a
    href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-calendar-day"
    target="_self"
    >live demo</a
  >]
</p>
<p>
  By building on top of basic-month-calendar, this moon calendar not only avoids
  the headaches of date math, it also automatically obtains a high degree of
  localizability provided by the underlying Globalize library. As improvements
  are made in the underlying basic-month-calendar, the moon calendar picks up
  those improvements for free.
</p>
<p>
  Here one web component (basic-month-calendar) allows a portion of its UI (the
  rendering of days) to be overridden by accepting a second web component class
  as input (via the dayTag attribute). The calendar is effectively an abstract
  component or meta-component that defines a structure which is completely or
  partially filled in by another class. This UI pattern parallels the use of
  abstract classes in programming languages, and seems generally useful in many
  other component situations.
</p>
<p>
  Patterns like this may go a long way toward ensuring web components can really
  be general purpose, and may ultimately be a key part of managing some of the
  date math and localization complexities I’ve touched upon in this post. As
  some of the calendar issues raised here suggest, it’s notoriously difficult to
  do anything with dates and time, especially when one wants to localize a UI
  across a wide range of languages and cultures. The best strategy for ensuring
  that someone, somewhere has sufficient motivation to fix tricky issues is to
  maximize the audience for the component. And one way to increase the size of
  the audience is to make the component as general-purpose as possible. That is,
  creating a wide range of scenarios for a general-purpose component like
  basic-month-calendar seems critical to ensure that the component gets
  sufficient attention to make it reliable in a wide range of circumstances.
