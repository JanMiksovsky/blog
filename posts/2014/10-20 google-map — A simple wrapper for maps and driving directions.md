  Many companies embed a hard-coded Google Map on their site to show, for
  example, the location of their office. This component allows you to easily
  create more dynamic maps. You could, for example, combine this with
  <a href="https://component.kitchen/components/ebidel/geo-location"
    >geo-location</a
  >
  to show your user's current location.

  You can combine the basic <code>google-map</code> component with the companion
  <code>google-map-directions</code> to provide driving directions from the user
  to your store, office, etc. This points toward a momentous promise: a domain-
  specific markup language for creating interactive maps.

  <strong>Dislikes:</strong>
  In its current state, this component mostly wraps the Google Maps API, which
  is powerful but rather complex if you're not already familiar with it. In many
  cases (e.g., a driving route with more than one stop), you'll be forced to use
  the more complex underlying API. Given Google's preemince in mapping, we'd
  love to see them push much further with this library of components.
