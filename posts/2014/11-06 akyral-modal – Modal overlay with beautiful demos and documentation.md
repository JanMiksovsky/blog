  We love the elegant demos and documentation
  <a href="https://github.com/filaraujo">filaraujo</a>
  is creating for his collection of web components. His akyral-modal component,
  for example, addresses the common need to have a modal dialog or other UI
  appear in front of other elements on the page. Several other modal components
  exist, but none so nicely documented.

  The author's taken care to give akyral-modal a bare-bones appearance. We find
  often it easier to add our own visual style to a plain component than to try
  to override a complex visual styling baked into a component's default
  appearance. We're also a big fan of interactive demos that can be configured
  on the fly. A demo is worth 10,000 words.
