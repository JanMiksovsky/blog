<p>
  This review focuses not on a component, but an <em>aspect</em> of a component
  called
  <a
    href="https://component.kitchen/components/basic-web-components/basic-list-box"
    >basic-list-box</a
  >. Component Kitchen released that component under the aegis of the
  <a href="https://github.com/basic-web-components/components-dev/wiki"
    >Basic Web Components</a
  >
  project. In our reviews, we want to avoid focusing too much on our own work,
  but in this case we can happily feature a small but important contribution to
  the project from developer
  <a href="https://twitter.com/marcysutton">Marcy Sutton</a>, a passionate
  advocate for building an accessible web that can be used by everyone.

  An important goal for Basic Web Components is to make all its components as
  accessible as possible, for several reasons. You can use these components,
  used as is, and reach the broadest possible range of users. You can extend
  these components or incorporate them into your own components, and
  automatically pick up a degree of support for accessibility. And you can refer
  to these components as good examples of how to implement accessibility if
  you’re creating a new component entirely from scratch. This work is just
  beginning, and by no means perfect, but those are the goals. The good news is
  that improvements are made to the components, anyone using those components
  can easily pick up those improvements for free.

<p>
  As a case in point, Marcy recently contributed an enhancement to
  basic-list-box (and a lower-level base class called
  <a
    href="https://component.kitchen/components/basic-web-components/basic-selector"
    >basic-selector</a
  >) that improves a list's accessibility through the use of appropriate
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">ARIA</a> features on the list
  itself and the individual items in the list. The best part about an
  improvement like this in a fundamental building block like basic-selector or
  basic-list-box means that you can achieve better accessibility simply by using
  those components. Even if you know nothing about ARIA and accessibility
  technologies, using these components makes your app likely to be more
  accessible than one constructed from a undifferentiated pile of divs.

<p>
  <strong>Noteworthy:</strong>
  Support for keyboard navigation, including Up/Down, Page Up/Down, Home/End.
  Appropriate use of ARIA roles and other attributes means that users who are
  blind or visually impaired can more easily identify and navigate a list of
  items.
