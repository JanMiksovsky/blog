<p>
  Sometimes the simplest approach works best. A number of registered web
  components aim to handle the simple task of showing or soliciting a star
  rating from a user using the now-convential set of 5 stars. On its own, a
  5-star rating system can present serious issues, as users tend to offer
  responses only at the extremes, but when managed well (adding users to add
  comments to explain their response, etc.), such rating systems can be useful.
</p>
<p>We tried three star rating components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://component.kitchen/components/dreyescat/rating-element"
      >rating-element</a
    >. We set aside this one aside when we found that it relies on an image
    sprite; in this age of responsive design, using an image sprite feels a bit
    antiquated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://component.kitchen/components/manoelneto/star-rating"
      >polymer-star-rating</a
    >. This is the most full-featured of the three components we looked at: in
    particular, it's the only one that lets you can use different symbols for
    each rating, instead of always using a star. We had some difficulties
    getting the component to work in a demo of our own. (We filed a bug.) There
    were some other confusing points as well: the package name (polymer-
    star-rating) doesn't match the element name (star-rating), and the component
    made assumptions about the location of dependencies like polymer.html that
    didn't match up with how we'd set up things. Still, we have high hopes for
    this component.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://component.kitchen/components/hershmire/x-rating"
      >x-rating</a
    >. This is the simplest component of the lot, but it worked immediately and
    did what we wanted. It uses Unicode code glyphs for the stars, which has the
    advantage of picking up the current text color. The glyph unfortunately
    isn't a parameter you can change, but that's nevertheless fine for the many
    cases in which you might want to just use a standard star.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Obviously, with any head-to-head comparison like this, it's hard to say which
  component is really "best" for everyone. But for our quick experiment, we
  found x-rating did the job simply and well, so that's the component we're
  showing in the accompanying demo. Nice work,
