<p>
  We've been eagerly tracking the state of the web components community since we
  started Component Kitchen earlier this year. Over that time, it's been
  exciting to watch the number of web components registered with
  <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a> grow from about 40 to nearly 500 today.
</p>
<p>
  The growth in our component catalog, however, has meant that it's becoming
  harder and harder for someone like you to find interesting components just by
  browsing around. We want to help you find the interesting stuff. To do that,
  we're making three changes to our site:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We've begun dedicating a portion of our own time to sifting through the
      catalog of web components for components that are notable in some way. We
      want to highlight components that: solve a common user interface design
      problem in a way that can be readily adopted in your own apps, demonstrate
      how to write good web components, or show off what's possible with web
      components.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we find a notable component, we'll write a small capsule review for
      it. Along with the review, we’ll craft our own little demo of that
      component being used in some common way. This demo will let us confirm to
      ourselves that the component works as advertised, and will also give us a
      feel for the component’s strengths and weaknesses. We hope these little
      demos will make it easier for you to see on a small scale what a component
      might do for you.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      We've redesigned our home page to feature these component reviews and
      other news (like this post). The home page previously featured a complete
      list of all registered components; that list is now available in the
      <a href="https://component.kitchen/components">Component Catalog</a>
      section of our site.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We've moved our temporary Component Kitchen blog feed in house. To get off
      the ground, we'd hosted our blog on a separate site, but you'll now find
      it here. If you'd like to keep track of what's happening in the world of
      web components,
      <a href="https://component.kitchen/feeds/blog.xml"
        >subscribe to our blog feed</a
      >
      at this new location.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We'll be scouring the catalog of components for interesting work, but if
  you've seen something you think is worth highlighting, please give us a shout
  at
  <a href="http://twitter.com/ComponentK">@ComponentK</a>!
