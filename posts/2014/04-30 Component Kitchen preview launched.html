<p>
  Today we’re excited to publicly announce the launch of a preview edition of
  our site at
  <a href="https://component.kitchen"
    ><span class="s1">https://component.kitchen</span></a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  At Component Kitchen, we think web components are fundamentally a great way to
  create apps and sites that run across an enormous range of desktop and mobile
  devices. We’re eager to help a mainstream audience learn about this
  technology, and discover for themselves how this technology is going to
  amplify their own creative capabilities as designers, developers, writers,
  students, business people, and more.
</p>
<p>
  Earlier this year, we observed that most of the material and tools related to
  web components was intended for a fairly experienced technical audience. We
  feel that, since web components extend what’s possible with plain HTML and
  CSS, web components is actually fundamentally interesting to a much broader
  audience: anyone who is comfortable editing HTML. That’s a lot of people!
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, we believe that people creating web components are going to need
  a range of services to help promote and distribute their components to a broad
  audience that includes both hardcore developers and people who work at the
  HTML level.
</p>
<p>We’re starting with a few basics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A
    <a href="https://component.kitchen/components">catalog of components</a>
    which have publicly registered for use. The preview release is quite basic,
    but includes some interesting features such as image previews for many
    components, and an ability to search the catalog.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <a href="https://component.kitchen/feeds/newComponents.xml"
      >New Web Components RSS feed</a
    >. Subscribe to learn about new components as soon as they’re registered.
  </li>
  <li>
    A
    <a href="http://discuss.component.kitchen/"
      >discussion board for talking about web components</a
    >. There are some other public forums for web components, but they focus on
    a highly technical audience. Lots of people will want to use components who
    have never heard of developer hangouts like GitHub or StackOverflow.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We have a number of interesting features ahead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Live, interactive, configurable component demos. You can see an example on
    the page for the <a
      href="https://component.kitchen/components/basic-web-components/basic-autosize-textarea"
      >basic-autosize-textarea</a
    > component. This lets you play with the component and see how its
    customization options will affect its appearance and behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    Web component hosting. Many people create HTML in environments like blogging
    platforms or mainstream web hosting platforms that don’t allow complete
    control over the site. If that’s you, we want to allow you to still take
    advantage of web components by hosting the components on Component Kitchen.
    Again, visit the
    <a
      href="https://component.kitchen/components/basic-web-components/basic-autosize-textarea"
      >basic-autosize-textarea</a
    >
    component for an example of component hosting. Click the Copy to Clipboard
    button, then paste the result in any HTML editor or environment. This will
    paste in the &lt;script&gt; and &lt;link&gt; tags that let you use that
    component from its hosted location on Component Kitchen.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our core mission is to help people create great products using web components.
  While we have many ideas for how we can do that, we’re most interested in
  hearing from you. If you have questions or suggestions for our site, let us
  know at <a href="https://twitter.com/ComponentK">@ComponentK</a> on Twitter,
  or on our discussion board.
</p>
<p>This is going to be <i>such</i> an exciting time to work on the web!</p>
