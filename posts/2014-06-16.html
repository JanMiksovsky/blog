<p dir="ltr">
  I recently contributed a small handful of web components to the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/basic-web-components/components-dev/wiki"
    target="_self"
    >Basic Web Components</a
  >&#0160;project, and wanted to share some observations on how designing and
  building UI with web components is going to be pretty different from how
  you’ve created UI in the past.
</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The basic photo carousel as a component</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  The web components I was working on are related to the standard sort of photo
  carousel you see everywhere on the web these days:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Basic-sequence-navigator"
    class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451fb6769e201a3fd1dbad4970b img-responsive"
    src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e201a3fd1dbad4970b-500wi.jpeg"
    alt="Basic-sequence-navigator"
  />
  <br /><br />There are a zillion widgets out there that will create such a
  thing for you, but they generally are connected to a specific web platform
  (WordPress, SquareSpace, etc.) or require the use of JavaScript.&#0160;
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  A carousel web component, on the other hand, lets you construct such a thing
  in HTML alone. Here&#39;s a carousel component called
  basic-sequence-navigator:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;basic-sequence-navigator&gt;<br />&#0160; &lt;img
    src=”image1.jpg”&gt;<br />&#0160; &lt;img src=”image2.jpg”&gt;<br />&#0160;
    &lt;img src=”image3.jpg”&gt;<br />&#0160; ...<br />&lt;/basic-sequence-navigator&gt;</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  You can see a live demo of this component on the Component Kitchen page for
  <a
    href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-sequence-navigator"
    target="_self"
    >basic-sequence-navigator</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  With a web component like this, you just drop your images (or other elements)
  inside of the component, and you get a carousel. No styling or JavaScript
  required. That’s pretty neat all on its own, but the component’s construction
  is also interesting in its own right.
</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Building up from simple pieces</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  Existing carousel widgets suffer from trying to present a final solution.
  Someone creates a single widget that handles everything: positioning the
  images, transition effects, Next/Previous buttons, programmatic API, events,
  and more. If there’s anything about that solution you don’t like, you often
  have to reject the whole widget, or else spend time fiddling with widget
  options in hopes of finding a combination of settings that does what you want.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  Given that web components lets you build bigger things from smaller things, I
  wanted to try to factor the carousel as a user experience into simple pieces
  that you could combine in different ways. Even if you don’t like a specific
  end result, you may nevertheless find some of the building blocks useful in
  constructing your own solution.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  For starters, consider that the Next/Previous buttons shown above are just a
  specific answer to the general question: how does a user navigate the sequence
  of images? Those buttons aren’t the only answer; there are other common
  answers to this same question. An equally common answer might be putting
  iOS-style dots along the bottom. So it’s silly to inextricably bundle the
  general problem of providing navigation through a sequence with the
  <em>specific</em> solution of Next/Previous buttons.
</p>
<p>
  A better answer is to factor the general behavior into one component, and the
  specific UI into a separate component. Accordingly, the
  basic-sequence-navigator component is really based on a more fundamental
  component called basic-sequence. The basic-sequence component handles
  transitional effects like sliding or cross-fading, but
  <em>doesn’t include its own navigation UI</em>.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  That means you can wire up buttons of your own (or any UI you want) to drive
  an instance of the more fundamental basic-sequence component. A crude example
  of this would be:
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;button
    onclick=&quot;document.querySelector(&#39;#sequence&#39;).previous()&quot;&gt;Previous&lt;/button&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;button
    onclick=&quot;document.querySelector(&#39;#sequence&#39;).next()&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;basic-sequence id=&quot;sequence&quot;&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&#0160; &lt;img src=”image1.jpg”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&#0160; &lt;img src=”image2.jpg”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&#0160; &lt;img src=”image3.jpg”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco">&#0160; ...</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;/basic-sequence&gt;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  You can see a demo of this solution on the page for
  <a href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-sequence" target="_self"
    >basic-sequence</a
  >. It&#39;s not beautiful, but the point is that&#0160;you can build up your
  own UI from simple pieces. You don’t have to write all the code —&#0160;you
  get things like transition effects for free, for example. At the same time,
  you can create exactly the user experience you want.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  Maybe you don’t want <em>any</em> visible UI, you just want to show one image
  after another on a timed basis. There’s a separate component called
  <a href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-slideshow" target="_self"
    >basic-slideshow</a
  >&#0160;that does just that. It uses basic-sequence under the covers, but adds
  the notion of a timer and play/stop semantics:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;basic-slideshow effect=”reveal”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&#0160; &lt;img src=”image1.jpg”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&#0160; &lt;img src=”image2.jpg”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&#0160; &lt;img src=”image3.jpg”&gt;</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco">&#0160; ...</span
  ><br /><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco"
    >&lt;/basic-slideshow&gt;</span
  >
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  What if you don’t care about transition effects? You can build on top of an
  even simpler component called
  <a href="http://component.kitchen/components/basic-modes" target="_self"
    >basic-modes</a
  >. That just shows one child element at a time. And even that component is
  built from simpler pieces, including
  <a
    href="http://polymer.github.io/core-selector/components/core-selector/"
    target="_self"
    >core-selector</a
  >, a component that just keeps track of which item in a set is selected
  (without defining what selecting means or looks like). And
  <em>that</em> component is built from even simpler one. It’s components, all
  the way down.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  The idea here is that UI shouldn’t be delivered as a huge, final thing with a
  million knobs on it to cover every conceivable situation. Instead, complex UI
  should be built up from simpler pieces, each of which do a great job at one
  thing.
</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Styleability</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  Of course, if you do like the general idea of Next and Previous buttons, but
  want them to look different, you can use basic-sequence-navigator, and then
  take advantage of the styleability built into web components. Using CSS rules,
  you can override the default styling to better match your app’s aesthetics and
  brand.
</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Get your UI for nothing, and accessibility for free</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  The basic-sequence-navigator component has a nice feature most carousels lack:
  keyboard support! If you press the Left or Right key while the component has
  focus, the carousel advances, respectively, to the previous or next image. To
  help make that feature more discoverable, the component sports a focus
  rectangle when it has the focus.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  It’s kind of appalling the web is chock full of photo carousels that can’t be
  navigated with a keyboard. That not only shuts out a big chunk of people for
  whom a mouse or trackpad is hard to use, it’s also generally inconvenient for
  everyone else. If you have to page back and forth through a sequence of
  images, using Left/Right keys is simply much faster than moving a mouse or
  finger back and forth to hit buttons on either side of the images.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  Some web sites, generally big ones with large staff, can afford to spend time
  getting accessibility details like keyboard navigation right. But I’m willing
  to bet that the vast majority of photo carousels on the web today aren’t
  accessible. The problem isn’t just awareness —&#0160;the software industry has
  been talking about accessibility for a long, long time. The deeper problem is
  that the economics of implementing accessibility are often terrible. If
  everyone has to implement something like keyboard support on their own, for
  any single team, the predicted return on the investment is just too low to
  pursue.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  With web components, the economics could improve radically. Once people can
  share UI solutions as components, even small improvements can potentially
  benefit thousands of sites. So someone may find it worth their time to add
  support for keyboard users, or users with low vision, or screen reader users,
  and so on. Even if the original author of a component (say, me) knows just a
  tiny bit about the accessibility implications of ARIA support, perhaps there’s
  someone else out there (you?) who knows ARIA inside and out and can help get
  it right.&#0160;
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  The best part is that, if accessibility can be improved for free, everyone
  benefits
  <em
    >even if most people won’t know they’re making their products more
    accessible</em
  >. Most people aren’t going to adopt a component like
  &lt;basic-sequence-navigator&gt; because it has good accessibility. They’re
  going to adopt it for selfish reasons — it’s going to save them time.&#0160;
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  That’s fine! If someone can just drop in a photo carousel component because it
  saves time implementing a design, they&#39;ll use it, even if they know
  nothing about accessibility. They don’t even need to know that the
  carousel&#39;s built-in accessibility features exist for the component to help
  them support a broader audience of end users.
