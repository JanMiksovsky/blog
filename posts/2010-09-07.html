  It takes a while for a designer on a mature product to realize that not all
  parts of the application&#39;s user interface are equally stable. As an
  application evolves over the course of years, it tends to develop some
  critically important yet unbelievably fragile component upon which too much
  rests. I picture such a feature as a scary basement: the dark, old,
  mysterious, and temperamental body of code which is vital to the running of
  the operation. The scary basement is cantankerous and hard to
  maintain—something only operated upon by the most senior and stalwart of the
  team&#39;s engineers, and conspicuously avoided by everyone else.
</p>
<p>
  When I worked as the lead designer on Microsoft Money, I eventually came
  across its scary basement: the elaborate checkbook register control for
  viewing and editing account transactions. This register control was first
  created around 1990 by legendary Microsoft engineer Doug Klunder. To get the
  most performance out of the PCs of the day, I believe he had the register
  itself more or less<em> directly read and write transaction data from disk</em
  >. In this capacity, this specific UI control was entirely and solely
  responsible for validating all transaction data; there was no separation
  between presentation, business logic, and on-disk representation.
</p>
<p>
  This gave rise to all sorts of odd restrictions. For instance, any dialog that
  created an account transaction had to instantiate, somewhere behind the
  scenes, a hidden instance of the register control. When the user entered data
  in dialog fields, the dialog carefully copied those values into the register,
  told the register to save it, and then tried to divine whether the save
  operation had worked.
</p>
<p>
  With each new product version, the register control had new functionality
  bolted on (investments, online banking, localized features), and each addition
  increased the complexity of the code. By the time I joined the team four years
  later, the register control had become so incredibly Byzantine, only one or
  two people on the team could, and would, touch it.

  A distinguishing characteristic of the scary basement is that all work on it
  will take an indeterminate length of time; any bug fixes or improvements are
  essentially uncostable. In the case of Money’s register control, simple
  changing the order of the transaction fields might take a day—or several
  weeks. There was just no way to tell beforehand.
</p>
<p>
  When I was first exposed to this reality, some friends on the nearby Microsoft
  Word team shared stories about their app&#39;s own scary basement: a routine
  called FormatLine. Given a point in a document and a column width, FormatLine
  would lay out the next line of text at that point. As I heard it, this routine
  had evolved into a handful of functions that were each thousands of lines
  long. Developers assigned to descend into the depths of FormatLine were
  treated with the same respect and concern as spelunkers attempting to reach
  trapped miners.

  The basement metaphor isn&#39;t just a way of describing the unnerving nature
  of tiptoeing around such a feature—it&#39;s meant to reflect the fact that
  such a feature is invariably foundational to the application. And like a
  building foundation, this code can’t be replaced with something more solid
  without a colossal engineering effort. In most cases, the scary basement just
  stays that way until the platform the app sits upon becomes irrelevant, and
  the app is ported over to some new, saner, foundation.
</p>
<p>
  To prevent a critically important aspect of your UI metastasize into a scary
  basement means investing time in refactoring as you go, and this means moving
  more slowly that you would like. UI changes need to be evaluated in terms of
  the degree to which they compromise the solidity of the foundation.

  This past week, a developer here at a Cozi came to me with a tough decision.
  I&#39;d designed what, IMHO, was an interesting modification of our family
  calendar UI that could have helped optimize screen real estate for both user
  data and advertising impressions. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks of
  working on this, the developer indicated that it was proving ferociously
  complicated to get the new UI to work correctly with the infinite scrolling on
  our calendar page. The infinite scrolling feature was itself delicate, and
  doing anything to it was complicated by the need to work across multiple
  browsers. While it might be possible to slowly stabilize this particular new
  feature to an acceptable level of quality, our calendar UI would likely become
  unacceptably fragile—the next feature we tried to add would apply new
  stresses, and things would break in unpredictable (and uncostable) ways. Our
  calendar UI would turn into a scary basement.
</p>
<p>
  We couldn&#39;t let that happen. For a family-focused product like Cozi, being
  able to evolve our calendar UI is crucial to the business. So while it was
  painful to let a neat feature improvement go, we ultimately decided that it
  wasn&#39;t the right time for it. Maybe someday cross-browser compatability
  won&#39;t be such a pain (probably when we can drop support for IE 7 and 8),
  and we&#39;ll give it another shot. In the meantime, we have a clean, well-lit
  basement.
