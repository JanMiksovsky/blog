<p>
  A European acquaintance once remarked that when they go to an American
  restaurant, they feel like they're &quot;under assault&quot; by the waitstaff:
  placing an order requires answering a long series of questions—&quot;Soup or
  salad? Italian dressing or Ranch? Lite Italian or Regular Italian?&quot;—and
  the waitstaff continues to interrupt them every ten minutes to ask yet more
  questions. Some user interfaces can feel like this.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, some applications have commands with UIs that ask too many
  questions before the application will actually carry out the command. If you
  try to insert a new page into a Microsoft Visio document, you get a form to
  fill out:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    class="image-full"
    alt="Microsoft_visio_new_page"
    title="Microsoft_visio_new_page"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/microsoft_visio_new_page.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  What you really wanted was a new page, not a form to fill out. The difference
  between ordering a salad and inserting a new page is that the restaurant has
  to get things right the first time. Once you get the salad, you can't change
  your mind and have them turn the salad into a soup (or, at least, not a very
  good soup).
</p>
<p>
  An application, in contrast, can adjust its output after the fact. Good UIs
  often eliminate unnecessary up-front questions by doing <em>something</em> in
  response to a command and letting you tweak the results if they're not what
  you wanted.
</p>
<p>
  A common example: when you create a new folder in virtually all modern
  operating systems, you get a new folder right away. The new folder is called
  something like &quot;New Folder&quot;. You don't get a question asking you
  what kind of folder you want, what sort of name you'd like to give it, etc.
  For this UI to be effective, the OS simply needs to make it easy for you to
  rename the new folder once it's been created.
</p>
<p>
  Another example comes from Microsoft Office. In old versions of Office, if you
  wanted to paste something from the clipboard that could be pasted in multiple
  ways, you had to use an ugly and confusing Paste Special dialog:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    class="image-full"
    alt="Microsoft_office_paste_special"
    title="Microsoft_office_paste_special"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/microsoft_office_paste_special.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Recent releases of Microsoft Office have deprecated this dialog in favor of a
  contextual pop-up menu that appears after commands like Paste. If you don't
  like the result of the command, you simply select another result from the
  pop-up menu:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    border="0"
    alt="Microsoft_office_paste_popup"
    title="Microsoft_office_paste_popup"
    src="https://miksovsky.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/microsoft_office_paste_popup.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Advances like these obviate the need for an application to bug the user with
  lots of questions. Other suggestions for streamlining command UI:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a single command is really providing two features that are only loosely
    related, refactor the command UI into two proper commands with their own
    entry points.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you have to ask a question, at least propose a default response and/or
    give examples of typical responses.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you have to present a dialog or wizard, consider employing some form of
    elision (an &quot;Advanced...&quot; button, an expando that reveals advanced
    options, etc.) to hide the unusual stuff.
  </li>

  <li>
    Instead of presenting a long sequence of questions, consider presenting a
    quick summary of what's going to happen, and let the user edit just those
    parts they want to change.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you really, really need to display a dialog (e.g., for legal reasons) but
    are confident most users won't actually need to see it each time, offer an
    option to skip past the dialog in the future.
  </li>

  <li>
    Have the basic form of the command do the thing that 95% of your users want,
    then let the remaining 5% tune the behavior of that command through an
    application option.
  </li>

  <li>
    If only a tiny number of users would ever answer a question a particular
    way, have guts and cut the question altogether. In general, you're better
    off addressing the common needs of a broad set of users than building
    special-purpose UI that only ever be used by a few people (especially if
    those few people work down the hall from you).
  </li>
</ul>
