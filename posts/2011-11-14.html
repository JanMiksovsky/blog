  Whether or not you’re the type of person that likes the way Facebook is
  evolving their UI, Facebook is certainly leaving no stone unturned in their
  search for possible improvements. In a recent change, they introduced a panel
  on the right side that shows the user’s live activity feed and an ad. This
  side panel is initially a bit below the blue toolbar, and vertically aligned
  with the top of “Recent Stories” on the left:

</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

  Keep an eye on the upper-right corner. When the user starts to scroll the
  page, the left side of the page scrolls out of view, but the right side panel
  bumps up against the toolbar and remains docked there:

</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  It’s hard to see in static images like this, but the right side panel remains
  entirely visible during scrolling, while the main portion of the page scrolls
  away under the blue toolbar.
</p>
<p>
  This is a pretty subtle bit of work to finesse the treatment of a small number
  of vertical pixels above the panel. It would be have been much simpler to have
  the panel always docked up right under the toolbar. I’d hazard a few reasons
  Facebook used this technique here. First, they <em>really </em>want to focus
  user attention on the critical “Update status” button at the top. Keeping the
  feed panel below that line creates a nice wide band of white space that puts
  the eye’s focus on the “Update status” button. If the panel were initially
  docked right below the toolbar, that button would be harder to find. At the
  same time, permanently keeping a vertical gap of 30 pixels or whatever between
  the toolbar and the panel wouldn’t be satisfactory either. Facebook users
  spend a lot of time scrolling through this page, and that gap would probably
  stand out once the buttons above the news feed were scrolled away. Finally,
  it’s possible that Facebook had plans to show an ad or other content
  <em>above</em> the panel, and developed this solution for that purpose, then
  later dropped that ad but kept the solution.
</p>
<p><strong>Key attributes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The persistent panel can either be to the side of the page content (as in
    the Facebook example above), or can span the width of the page content (as a
    toolbar).
  </li>
  <li>
    In both the side panel and toolbar cases, any content above the panel can
    scroll off, but the panel stays visible. In Facebook’s case, it just happens
    there’s only white space above the panel (and below the blue toolbar). Other
    sites put content above the panel or toolbar that they initially want the
    user to see at least once, but which can later scroll away.
  </li>
  <li>
    As the panel just begins to move out of view (off the top of the viewport),
    there may be a single jerky repositioning of the panel, but otherwise it’s
    quite stable. This is a significant improvement over earlier techniques to
    keep certain page elements visible. Some sites have tried to keep a side
    panel visible by using JavaScript to constantly adjust the panel’s position
    as the user scrolls, but the resulting performance is jerky and distracting.
    Yelp used to do this, for example, and tried to add a
    <a href="http://www.wittycomments.com/map-stay-put">Map, stay put!</a> check
    box that disabled the behavior, but ultimately concluded it was better to
    just drop this repositioning behavior entirely. In contrast, the technique
    here uses JavaScript to flip the document’s CSS position to “fixed”whenever
    the panel would otherwise be scrolled out of the viewport. This may jerk the
    panel into the correct position once, but thereafter the result feels very
    stable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In general, I think this is a technique more sites, particularly
  advertising-funded sites, could productively adopt.&#0160;For example, I’ve
  noticed that Google’s recent app redesigns are leaving them with much thicker
  sets of controls permanently stuck at the top of a page. It’d be nice if at
  least some of those controls could scroll away, leaving only the most
  important there all the time, and giving more room to the document I’m reading
  or editing.
</p>
<p><strong>PersistentPanel control</strong></p>
<p>
  I’ve posted a
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/PersistentPanel">PersistentPanel</a>
  control to the QuickUI Catalog. There are two demos:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A demo of a
    <a
      href="http://quickui.org/catalog/PersistentPanel/persistentPanelSideDemo.html"
      >persistent side panel</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    A demo of a
    <a
      href="http://quickui.org/catalog/PersistentPanel/persistentPanelToolbarDemo.html"
      >persistent toolbar</a
    >
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p>
  Use a PersitentPanel to offer a small number of controls that are so important
  they should always be within quick reach. As shown in both demos, a
  PersistentPanel can be used when some content must initially appear above the
  panel so that it attracts enough attention. If this content can later scroll
  away, a PersistentPanel can ensure that the tools or information below the ad
  can remain visible. Without this requirement (for content to appear above the
  panel), it’s probably simpler to give the toolbar or panel a permanent
  position along the top, side, or bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
  Note: Both demos show an ad scrolling <em>away</em>. Facebook uses the same
  panel concept to keep an ad <em>visible</em>. Which way you go depends upon
  how likely it is that your users are going to click ads as soon as they see
  them, or whether you think the additional revenue from persistent ads makes up
  for the permanent clutter.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>
<p>
  The basic strategy here is to have the panel content sit within a placeholder
  element that can occupy the same space as the content whenever the content is
  switched to position: fixed. Without that placeholder, content below the panel
  would reflow in an unacceptable manner whenever the panel pops into and out of
  the normal document flow.
</p>
<p>
  This is the first control I’ve done in this blog series that actually worked
  in IE8 without modification. Hooray! I usually start in Firefox, then test in
  Chrome and IE9. (I rarely test in Safari, as I’ve yet to create something that
  works in Chrome but not in Safari.) Then I take a deep breath, open the demo
  in IE8, and brace for some weird bugs. But this time IE8 played nice and
  everything worked. Good IE! Sit. Stay.
</p>
<p>
  Although I’ve never seen a PersistentPanel dock against the bottom of the
  viewport, that case wasn’t hard to handle, so I added support for that as
  well.
</p>
<p>
  In both the toolbar and side panel demos, I wanted to block out the space for
  an IAB universal ad unit, so I created a general
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/AdPlaceholder">AdPlaceholder</a> control
  for that purpose. Now I’ve got a control I can use to quickly say, “Leave room
  for a Leaderboard here”, which is nice. This is one case where I’m thinking
  the control’s generic style should be a bit more colorful and distracting, to
  better approximate the visual noise of a page with ads.

    >Extra: In response to feedback, I&#39;ve begun investing in documentation
    for using the QuickUI framework in plain JavaScript. People are often
    intrigued by the framework, but put off by idea of having to use a
    proprietary markup language (however elegant and efficient it may be).
    Everything in QuickUI, including all the catalog controls, is already
    accessible in plain JavaScript, although there&#39;s yet sufficient
    documentation for how to do this. So, in parallel with these control posts,
    I&#39;m also working on documentation that addresses that gap. The first
    piece in that series is a list of the </em
