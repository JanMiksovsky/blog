  Once again, it’s amazing how hard it is to get the small stuff right. Building
  on both

    >last week’s CalendarMonthNavigator post</a
  >
  and the
  <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2011/10/listcombobox.html"
    >earlier ComboBox post</a
  >, this week’s control is the standard date picker found in countless web
  sites and applications. Date pickers are generally optimized to pick a date in
  the near future, such as a date of travel or a date for an upcoming
  appointment. Here’s a typical example from Google Calendar:
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

      width="161"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Key attributes</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The control always includes a text box. In the control&#39;s normal state,
    this may be all that is visible. Generally speaking, clicking in the text
    box or moving focus to it opens the dropdown calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    The control may include an icon, often a downward-pointing arrow,&#0160;to
    the right side of the text box&#0160;to indicate that the user can interact
    with the control to make a selection from a set of choices (i.e., the popup
    calendar). Some controls that offer an icon will require the user to click
    there to open the calendar, and will <em>not</em> dropdown the calendar when
    the user clicks in the text box.
  </li>
  <li>
    The input portion of the combo box and the dropdown portion are generally
    kept in sync. As the user types, the calendar reflects the new date. As the
    user navigates the calendar, the text box shows the new date.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user is generally expected to enter dates in short date format. In the
    U.S., this is month/day/year.
  </li>
  <li>
    The control validates the user’s typed text to verify it represents a date.
    This validation may occur as the user types, after they move the focus away,
    or when they try to save the form.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some variants of this control (e.g., Expedia’s) show two calendar months at
    a time. This makes it easier to select a date in the next few weeks when the
    current month is almost over.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ideally, the dropdown should implicitly close if the user tabs away from the
    field or switches to a different window.
  </li>
  <li>
    The dropdown calendar may offer a “Today” button that lets the user quickly
    select, or jump back to, the current date.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Given the wide variety of implementations, and the complexity of this control,
  it’s not surprising to see wide variation of the quality of implementations.
  Some do a terrible job dealing with loss of keyboard focus, some don’t parse
  dates very well, some can’t keep the text and calendar in sync, and so on.
</p>
<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>
  Date pickers seem boring, but I think there’s something quite fascinating
  about them: they may represent a theoretical maximum of complexity possible in
  a monolithic approach to creating user interface elements. Nearly every user
  interface framework will offer a date picker — but they will rarely offer
  something more complex. Why is this?
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Apps need to let people enter valid dates that a program can understand.
    This means constraining input and/or parsing dates, and usually rendering a
    month calendar — and all these tasks turn out to be pretty hard. The problem
    gets even harder when one wants to handle multiple cultures.
  </li>
  <li>
    The standard combo box solution for a date picker means that, in its normal
    state, the control to look very boring. It’s just a text box. This lets it
    fit in with pretty much any application’s visual style.
  </li>
  <li>
    The popup calendar month navigator may not always look elegant, or fit in
    with the app’s visual style, but since it’s only a transient part of the
    user experience, design teams decide they can live with it — especially when
    confronted with a realistic development cost for something better.
  </li>
  <li>
    The variety of situations that come up when picking a single date in the
    near future is small enough that a monolithic control can handle most of the
    common situations. Suppose you want to constrain the selected date to a
    weekday. You can probably find a date picker that lets you handle that
    specific constraint.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The problem is that, once you get outside the narrow set of common scenarios,
  you’re out of luck. Suppose you want to let the user pick <em>two</em> dates
  that are usually close together. In the example above, they want to let the
  user pick the departure and return dates for a trip. But picking a date range
  is beyond the complexity of most date pickers. Even if they wanted to support
  that scenario, the variety of needs would quickly multiple out of control.
  Some apps would want to force the two dates to be within a certain number of
  days of each other, others would want to force the two dates to be a minimum
  number of days apart, and so on. There’s just no way to build a monolithic
  date picker than can handle all the common cases with a big pile of properties
  governing control behavior. So user interface frameworks give up on this
  problem, offer the single-date date picker, and let everyone cobble together
  multiple date pickers to get the desired result.
</p>
<p>
  In an extensible user interface framework, you could simply provide all the
  building blocks required to construct a date picker, then let app designers
  snap those together to get the control they want. So if they want a stock
  single-date picker, fine, that’s provided, but the same <em>parts </em>can
  also be snapped together to produce a two-date date picker, or whatever else
  is needed. Those in turn can be offered as reusable user interface controls.
</p>
<p><strong>HTML 5 is not going to solve your problem</strong></p>
<p>
  The HTML 5 spec defines a new “date” input type, allowing the browser to
  provide a standard date picker UI. That effort is laudable, but so far
  inadequate for all but the most basic needs.
</p>
<p>
  The stock date picker controls in the mainstream browsers are god-awful. (<a
    href="http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_form_date"
    >Try your own browser’s date control</a
  >.) Here’s a screen shot of Chrome’s date control:<br />
  <br /><a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e20154369ce82f970c-pi"
    ><img
      alt="Chrome Date Picker"
      border="0"
      height="22"
      src="/images/flowstate/6a00d83451fb6769e20162fc1eb26b970d-pi.png"
      style="
        background-image: none;
        padding-left: 0px;
        padding-right: 0px;
        display: inline;
        padding-top: 0px;
        border: 0px;
      "
      title="Chrome Date Picker"
      width="194"
  /></a>
  <br />
  <br />This is an unadulterated user interface disaster. The format Chrome’s
  decided to support (YYYY-MM-DD) is one that might be helpful to programmers,
  but I expect essentially zero consumers actually use it in their personal
  lives. I can’t think of a single situation in normal life where that format is
  even seen. In the U.S., at least, people expect to enter a short date like
  “11/7/2011”, but this format is rejected by Chrome’s control. So this
  browser’s standard date picker fails to support its home country’s<em
    >&#0160;single most common input format</em
  >. And the little up/down spinner arrows are completely out of place here.
  They only advance the day portion of the date, they’re tiny hit targets, they
  don’t let people think in calendar terms, etc., etc. And let’s not overlook
  the fact that so little attention has been paid to this control that the “up”
  spinner button is missing its top border.
</p>
<p>
  If you take a look at
  <a href="http://marxsoftware.blogspot.com/2011/01/html5-date-picker.html"
    >Opera’s date picker</a
  >, it’s more functional (it adds a dropdown arrow, a real calendar navigator,
  etc.) but, visually speaking, it still looks terrible. It’s hard to imagine a
  design team happy including this bit of UI in a consumer-facing application.
</p>
<p>
  If these controls represent the sorts of designs which browser creators are
  capable of creating, that doesn’t bode well for the notion that adding
  <em>more</em> semantics to HTML is going to solve any meaningful user
  interface problems. Either the browser designers don’t care about those
  controls, or they don’t have the expertise to design them well, or they don’t
  see a payoff in doing so. It’s worth noting that having the browser try to
  solve everyone’s date picker needs is an even more implausible answer than
  having a monolithic date picker control solve everyone’s date picker needs.
  Browser controls are <em>less </em>flexible than nearly every date picker
  control out there.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever the case, in their current state, I wouldn’t advise anyone to use
  these controls on a web site where even modest usability or aesthetics are a
  requirement. For reference: Even Google Calendar doesn’t even use Google
  Chrome’s own date picker.
</p>
<p>
  The situation is different on mobile platforms, where the browser can fall
  back to the OS’ native date picker UI. They are generally well-designed, or at
  least have received a considerable amount of design attention (those are
  different statements).
</p>
<p>
  On all platforms, it should be observed that there’s nothing that says a
  dropdown combo box is the ultimate UI for picking a date. In fact, in many
  applications, an inline calendar might actually be preferable. If you have a
  page that’s all about getting the user to pick a date in the near future, why
  force them to have to dropdown the calendar first? This is just to say that
  the right control for the job really depends on context. If anyone tells you
  that you <em>must</em> use the stock HTML 5 elements to let users enter data,
  I’d think very hard about whether that person actually has the interests of
  your users (and your business) in mind, or are simply touting a standard
  because it’s a standard.

<p><strong>The DateComboBox control</strong></p>
<p>
  I’ve posted a
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/DateComboBox">DateComboBox</a> control to
  the QuickUI Catalog. (Taxonomy note: this control is called DateComboBox
  instead of DatePicker to reflect the fact that it’s a combo box, and the fact
  that there are many other UIs possible for picking a date.)
</p>

      title="DateComboBox"
      width="212"
  /></a>
</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>
  As noted last week, the generic appearance of these controls is minimalist by
  design; they’re meant to be useful and unobtrusive as is, but can also receive
  further styling, subclassing, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p>
  Use DateComboBox in situations where you want to let the user type or choose a
  single date (especially one in the near future) and space is a concern or you
  don’t want to focus too much attention on the date. If picking a date is, in
  fact, the focus of a UI, then it may be more appropriate to use an inline
  calendar, such as a
  <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/CalendarMonthNavigator"
    >CalendarMonthNavigator</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Note that, if the user omits a year, the current year will be assumed. In
  applications I’ve worked on that let users enter dates (Microsoft Money,
  Cozi), we always found that users generally expect dates without a year to
  reflect the <em>future</em>. E.g., if it’s November 2011, and a calendar user
  in the U.S. creates an appointment with a date of “2/15”, they expect the
  appointment to end up on February 15, 2012 (in the future) and not February
  15, 2011 (the current year, but in the past). At some point, this might be
  worth fixing in DateComboBox, but for now the control makes the more
  simplistic assumption about current year.
</p>
<p>
  DateComboBox uses
  <a
    href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2010/09/form-validation-feedback-be-slow-to-complain-and-quick-to-forgive.html"
    >asymmetric validation</a
  >, which is to say that it will be slow to complain and quick to forgive. By
  default, if the user types an invalid date, this fact is not reflected
  visually by an error state until the user leaves the field (or, depending on
  the UI, saves the form). However, any error state is removed immediately upon
  the keypress that fixes the error; the user doesn’t have to leave the field to
  see whether their date entry is now acceptable to the app.
</p>
<p>
  Because the content of the days in the dropdown calendar can be customized,
  you’re not limited to just showing dates in the calendar. You could show a
  small amount of date-specific information (e.g., room availability) in the
  calendar itself, helping the user make a more informed initial date choice.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>
<p>
  To me, the most interesting aspect of the implementation here is that the
  DateComboBox is assembled by snapping together three main controls, are three
  of which are interesting in their own right:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The dropdown portion of the combo box is a
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/CalendarMonthNavigator"
      >CalendarMonthNavigator</a
    >, the exact same control used to create the
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/FlickrInterestingnessNavigator"
      >FlickrInterestingnessNavigator</a
    >
    last week.
  </li>
  <li>
    The input portion of the combo box is a
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/DateTextBox">DateTextBox</a>. This is a
    subclass of
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ValidatingTextBox">ValidatingTextBox</a
    >, and is responsible for parsing typed dates.
  </li>
  <li>
    The above elements are joined in a
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ComboBox">ComboBox</a>. This is the same
    parent class which was used to create the
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ListComboBox">ListComboBox</a> and
    <a href="http://quickui.org/catalog/ColorSwatchComboBox"
      >ColorSwatchComboBox</a
    >
    discussed earlier.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since I already had the first and third controls in the catalog, the bulk of
  the work this week was building a reasonable solid date-parsing text box. The
  hardest part of that work was handling tricky event interactions to ensure,
  among other things, that the user could navigate within a dropped-down
  calendar; that behavior to some extent conflicts with the desire to have the
  dropdown automatically close whenever the user moves the focus away from the
  text box.
</p>
<p>
  I was happy I could delegate much of the date parsing responsibility to the
  fantastic jQuery
  <a href="https://github.com/jquery/globalize">Globalize</a> library mentioned
  last time, which covers a huge range of culture-specific date formats. In
  addition to supporting a standard short date format, Globalize also parses a
  number of other date formats, which is nice even if most users won’t ever use
  them. (If the culture is set to English, for example, you can type “January
  2012”, and that will get parsed and shown as 1/1/2012.) If Globalize is not
  present, then the control falls back to a simpler parser that supports
  U.S.-style short dates (e.g., 12/31/2011).
</p>
<p>
  I extended the supported abbreviated formats to handle short years (e.g.,
  12/31/11) and missing year (12/31). Those formats come up daily in people’s
  normal lives, so I thought it was important that a date control handle them.
  (It drives users absolutely nuts that, when scheduling a flight or booking a
  hotel, they have to enter a full four digit year. Is there some
  <em>other</em> century they’re going to be traveling in?) The supported
  abbreviated formats are sensitive to the local culture, so in France those
  examples would look like 31/12/11 and 31/12, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  This control is designed for full web browsers only. At noted above, mobile
  browsers already provide fairly good date pickers. It should be
  straightforward to create a control that uses the HTML 5 date field on a
  mobile browser and a DateComboBox otherwise.
</p>
