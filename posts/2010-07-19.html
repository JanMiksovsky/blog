  Like the panels in a comic, the sequence of pages in a user interface requires
  <em>closure</em> in the user’s mind to logically connect each step with the
  preceding step. At each step, the user is trying to mentally confirm that the
  place they’ve just arrived logically follows from the action they just took in
  the previous step. A designer can create a smooth experience by ensuring good
  closure; a disjoined interface can interfere with closure, producing
  substantial confusion.

  Scott McCloud describes the concept of closure in comics in his book,

  subconsciously fills in the action that must be taking place
  <em>between</em> the comic’s panels in order to give sense to the story.

  Users of a software product perform similar closure any time an interface
  transitions between states: the user clicks a button and a window appears;
  they click a link and their browser navigates to another page; they type
  something and a button becomes enabled. Like the comic reader, the user
  connects (at least subconsciously) what they’re looking at now with what they
  just did. The closure either helps confirm that they’re on the right track, or
  gives them pause to wonder whether things are amiss. Interfaces that
  facilitate closure produce a smooth user experience and a satisfying sense of
  control and accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
  Any time the interface interrupts the user with an unasked-for dialog, page,
  or similar state, the product runs the risk of irritating or confusing the
  user. Errors are often especially problematic in this regard. A user clicks a
  button that says, “Save”, and an error appears telling them that a particular
  field is required. The user must expend enormous mental effort to achieve
  closure between the thing they asked for, and the error they ended up with.

  Cozi recently completed an A/B test experimenting with the destination of a
  “Calendar” link on the Home page. Cozi’s calendar is oriented towards
  families, and allows a family to color-code appointments with the names of the
  family members who will attend. For this to work, the user has to first enter
  the names of their family members. Usability studies had shown that users who
  didn’t complete that task before entering the calendar overlooked that aspect
  of the product, so we were looking for ways to encourage users to perform that
  simple setup task.
</p>
<p>
  Users in the control condition who clicked the “Calendar” link went straight
  to their calendar, while users in the experimental condition went to a page
  that asked for their family member names and <em>then</em> took them to the
  calendar.

<p>
  The experiment results indicates that the control condition performed better
  than the experimental condition in getting new users to adopt Cozi. This
  surprised us, because earlier experiments showed that completing this simple
  setup task gives the user a better calendar experience. However, it seems that
  forcing the users through a setup task they didn’t ask for had the
  counter-productive result of making them less likely to use the product.
</p>
<p>
  There are likely many factors at work here, but I expect at least one factor
  is that the flow violated the user’s expectations. In other words, the closure
  between the two states in the experiment was not as satisfying. When a user
  clicks a link that says, “Calendar”, they expect the very next thing they see
  to be a calendar. That’s an eminently reasonable expectation. When the
  experiment didn’t meet their expectations, they had reason to believe that the
  <em>next</em> link they clicked on wouldn’t deliver them to their desired
  destination either (perhaps they were now trapped in some wizard of indefinite
  length) and they gave up.
