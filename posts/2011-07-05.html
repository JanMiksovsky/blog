  While reviewing UI text recently, a question arose regarding exactly which
  words in a sentence should be used as a hyperlink. My standard tactic to cut
  through this design problem is to ask: what if your user were blind? Assume
  they have a screen reader that, by default, is going to let them tab through
  just the links on the page and read the link text aloud to them. Which link
  text would produce the best experience?

  At Microsoft I was first exposed to the proposition that creating products
  with universal access in mind (i.e., making the product’s features accessible
  to users who were visually impaired, hearing impaired, motion impaired, etc.)
  would also produce benefits for all users. I’d love to see a rigorous defense
  of this proposition from an economic point of view: could resources invested
  toward universal access have produced better products if those resources have
  been invested elsewhere? But even without that defense, I do believe this
  mindset opens up new ways of looking at design problems.

  Although the W3C published its
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/"
    >guidelines for creating accessible web content</a
  >
  in 2000, including the specific admonition that
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#link-text"
    >“click here” is a bad link choice</a
  >, it’s nevertheless common to find this still done over a decade later.
  Here&#39;s a random news article:

  To get an approximate sense of how this page might appear to a blind user (via
  the default screen reader experience) you can remove all the text that
  surrounds the links. You can easily do this on almost any web page by using
  your browser’s developer tools to change the body and paragraph text color to
  match the background color:

  With the body text rendered invisible, the use of the link text “here” in
  “Click <span style="text-decoration: underline">here</span> to see a sample of
  the new Calendar redesign” jumps out. If the link text had been written
  without depending on the surrounding text, perhaps better link text might have
  been selected: e.g., “See a
  <span style="text-decoration: underline"
    >sample of the new Calendar design</span
  >”. The link text “wrote” could be similarly improved.
</p>
<p>
  I think it’s striking that, even when one tries <em>very hard </em>to focus on
  just the link text in the first image, you still don’t get the same experience
  as the second image. The second image makes it impossible for your eyes to
  grab a little bit of context from the surrounding text.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the persistence of weak link text can be partially attributed to the
  assumption that web usability guidelines for, say, visually impaired users,
  apply only to companies or organizations that focus on those users. In this
  case, following the guidelines for link text (and using link titles that
  appear on hover, etc.) can benefit all your users.
</p>
<p>
  I can’t pretend to understand or fully appreciate the user experience of blind
  users. I can speak to the question of what a typical user does when scanning
  UI text: they tend to focus on the links. Writing as if the surrounding body
  text were going to be invisible can help guide you in the selection of good
  link text.
